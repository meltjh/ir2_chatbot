<bos> the film was awful and extremely boring . <eos>
<bos> the terminator <eos>
<bos> the worst trek movie <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great movie for both adults and kids with a storyline that family matters . <eos>
<bos> punches the boy <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s not trying to be the meaning of life , it <unk> ' s the movie that made a big break through . <eos>
<bos> this is one of the best films of the year , and of recent years . <eos>
<bos> a masterwork for all time ... <eos>
