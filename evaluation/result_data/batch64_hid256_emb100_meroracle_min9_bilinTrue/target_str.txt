<bos> i like the one in which toothless smiles <unk> at <unk> for the first time . <eos>
<bos> it turns out dragons are just big kitty - cats : they like to be <unk> , there <unk> ' s a kind of grass that <unk> ' s like cat - <unk> to them , and they love fish ( but hate <unk> ) . ) <eos>
<bos> this is a huge accomplishment for dreamworks animation , it might actually be its best animated <unk> it yet . <eos>
<bos> i may of had the most fun that i <unk> ' ve ever had in cinema watching how to train your dragon . <eos>
<bos> this is why you go to the movies <eos>
<bos> never watched it . <eos>
<bos> final half of the second story <eos>
<bos> compared to its predecessors , i found the first movie highly gripping for its unique <unk> and interesting characters , while the sequel did n ' t really catch me due to a plain storyline and little creativity . <eos>
<bos> this may eventually be a teaser lurking me into reading the books <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was paulie . <eos>
<bos> i give <unk> ' rocky ii <unk> ' <unk> a hearty recommendation it <unk> ' s a truly solid sequel that surprises us right when we expect to be disappointed . <eos>
<bos> he is greeted with the cheers and <unk> of onlookers as he runs through the streets of south philadelphia <eos>
<bos> i like them ; they entertain me , and i think they all serve their purpose . <eos>
<bos> i think it was the worst american pie of the 3 <eos>
<bos> this movie is very similar to the original and normally i have a problem with this . <eos>
<bos> most of them are good but the first one stands on it <unk> ' s own . always been a favourite of mine . <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ll be first to admit that i hate teen comedies in general and typically <unk> upon most of them <unk> - <unk> i did n ' t even like <unk> " <unk> there <unk> ' s something about mary <unk> " <unk> too much , although i <unk> ' m not sure it <unk> ' s really a <unk> " <unk> teen <unk> " <unk> film . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great movie and a good modern twist on the classic . <eos>
<bos> the cgi becomes a distraction here ; it <unk> ' s when things look too perfect that they lose believability such as freddy bending the wall above nancy . <eos>
<bos> that was scary , creative and left people thinking that perhaps nancy was imagining krueger and that rod had hung himself . <eos>
<bos> incredibly disappointing , a slap in the face to true horror fans <eos>
<bos> i liked the one with the dance by uma thurman and john travolta <eos>
<bos> i agree i think the movie is nothing special <eos>
<bos> there <unk> ' s a nice moral progression to the stories . we <unk> that vincent hesitates to sleep with mia out of fear rather than loyalty . later , <unk> <unk> ' s act of heroism could be motivated by honor , but we <unk> ' re never sure . <eos>
<bos> none of the stories are really <unk> " <unk> about <unk> " <unk> anything . they certainly are not about hit - men <unk> about burgers . nor is the film really a satire or a farce , although it contains elements of both . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was ruth sunday because she seemed to be the only compassionate character in the movie . <eos>
<bos> and the cinematography ? welcome to the old days of film . the glory days of hollywood . anderson gives us one of the most beautifully shot and directed films in recent memory <eos>
<bos> every moment feels more epic than the last , until the film becomes such a <unk> cinematic spectacle that the end leaves the viewer exhausted . <eos>
<bos> and casablanca is n ' t gon na be in theaters again any time soon . but in the meantime , there will be blood is just about as good , and will likely haunt our generation as much as the hollywood studio epics of the past ... <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was max fischer , his delusional world outlook is wonderful . <eos>
<bos> the contrast of max <unk> ' s middle - class background with the wealthy and privileged lives of most rushmore students feeds max <unk> ' s determination to make a name for himself . <eos>
<bos> they simply will not appeal to those out there who want <unk> hollywood fodder . <eos>
<bos> anderson breaks convention in ways no one has done before <unk> - <unk> one has to understand that his films are deep where most films are shallow , and shallow where most films are deep . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a overly intense , overly gory movie , i love horror movies , but it was ridiculous in the amount of gore . <eos>
<bos> of course as has been the case with all the sequels thus far , the message is n ' t quite as clear here as it was in the original , and the ideas always seem to be <unk> the gore rather than the other <unk> - more appropriate - <unk> way around <eos>
<bos> a stumble , but still on mission . <eos>
<bos> not enough for anyone else , but fans should enjoy it for the most part . <eos>
<bos> but it <unk> ' s still solid and entertaining . <eos>
<bos> although it <unk> ' s easy to interpret total recall in a very straightforward manner , so that the bulk of what we <unk> ' re seeing at any particular moment and the bulk of the dialogue are the literal reality , very convincing arguments can be made that the majority of the film is a depiction of quaid <unk> ' s memory <unk> while in the <unk> " <unk> patient <unk> ' s chair <unk> " <unk> at <unk> . <eos>
<bos> what matters more than thinking one has a <unk> " <unk> right answer <unk> " <unk> , though , is the deeply captivating story that provokes our interpretations and the amount of fun we have getting there . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was jim carrey <unk> - ace <eos>
<bos> sure , this is <unk> comedy , but jim carrey makes it memorable . <eos>
<bos> jim carrey is quite simply amazing , i never stopped laughing the whole way through the movie . <eos>
<bos> everything ace does made me laugh , from <unk> football player <unk> ' s with a towel to get a ring <unk> to showing up at a mansion party and being his usual manic self . 100 laughs per hour , if you have a sense of humour , then this movie is for you ! <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was danny glover , he gave true emotions in the movie . <eos>
<bos> it introduced a whole new bunch of <unk> weapons , tactics and behavior which never ever seemed out of place and were perfect fits . <eos>
<bos> i love this movie ! <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which po first gets to the panda village . <eos>
<bos> such a beautiful film . not as dark as the previous kung fu panda , but still a pleasure to watch . <eos>
<bos> a full - blooded , joyous , intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon <eos>
<bos> liked the movie a lot , especially the little details . for example , q <unk> ' s coffee <unk> had a <unk> letter <unk> value <unk> on it . perfect . <eos>
<bos> one minute he ca n ' t shoot ... 10 seconds later he shoots everyone in a <unk> arc ? <eos>
<bos> i loved that they brought back the original office , with the same desk , coat rack and leather <unk> door . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which clark uncovers the capsule that brought him to earth . <eos>
<bos> not that bad of a sequel . i <eos>
<bos> i thought prior was great . <eos>
<bos> i hear people complain all the time that they hate the comedy that prior brought to the film because superman is supposed to be , and these are actual quotes , <unk> " <unk> gritty <unk> " <unk> and <unk> " <unk> realistic <unk> " <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the individual moments , not the payoff , that make it so effective . <eos>
<bos> here you have this <unk> " <unk> typical <unk> " <unk> 21 <unk> - <unk> year <unk> - <unk> old , drinking with his friends , getting into fights , etc etc , but you look below the surface and there <unk> ' s a lot more to him . <eos>
<bos> <unk> asks will to move to california with her , where she will begin medical school at <unk> <eos>
<bos> i also liked to watch how will <unk> around his buddies ; the four guys really seemed as if they had known each other all their lives . <eos>
<bos> overall , i thought this movie was believable and touching , without your typical ending . <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which <unk> <unk> finally gets to fight the man who killed his father . <eos>
<bos> i felt the same way after watching the big lebowski 5 years after it been out . <eos>
<bos> one that easily coincides with the film <unk> ' s sensibilities . <eos>
<bos> for the scene of <unk> , elwes and <unk> had to study <unk> for months , which is impressive , but on - screen , i had no trouble believing that they were characters who had <unk> for at least several years . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which ryan gosling does the lift with emma stone <eos>
<bos> bittersweet , <eos>
<bos> i enjoyed everything about this movie . <eos>
<bos> they are not given nearly as much to do as the guys , but hold their own on - <unk> screen . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which james bond meets raoul <unk> for the first time when bond is tied to the chair and <unk> playfully teases him about his plans and asks him to join him while revealing his feelings about <eos>
<bos> the third henchman grabs bond <unk> ' s <unk> " <unk> signature <unk> " <unk> pistol and tries to shoot him , but the palm - print id wo n ' t let the gun activate itself . <eos>
<bos> liked the movie a lot , especially the little details . for example , q <unk> ' s coffee <unk> had a <unk> letter <unk> value <unk> on it . perfect <eos>
<bos> loved it . deakins did work , as usual . guy is pure class . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great movie and a good sequel . <eos>
<bos> more of the same , but it <unk> ' s welcome <eos>
<bos> the rest of the cast all pretty much played their parts well , so i am pleased to announce that there are n ' t any exceptionally bad actors or actresses . <eos>
<bos> in addition of the immersive storyline , it created a much enjoyable film . for a sequel , this actually surprised me because i enjoyed this movie as much as i did the first . <eos>
<bos> i think the movie was a wonderful cinematic experience for his time . <eos>
<bos> you won ! you won ! <unk> " <unk> he cries , reaching for charlie to hug him . <eos>
<bos> gene wilder revealed ... <eos>
<bos> one of my all - time favourites . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great movie and they did a good job depicting what <unk> " <unk> happened <unk> " <unk> , they brought it to a level that children growing up in the 90 <unk> ' s could understand . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s a goofy , simple and <unk> movie about a gun deal going bad . <eos>
<bos> i loved the sound design in this film , the loudness of the gunshots especially in my theatre made the showing that lot more intense <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> hello , my name is <unk> <unk> . you killed my father . prepare to die ! <eos>
<bos> i watched this movie <unk> <unk> for a year when i was a kid . <eos>
<bos> i watched it with my parents when i was very young , and have been watching it constantly ever since . <eos>
<bos> the movie has a place in my heart , and that will never go away . <eos>
<bos> i think it was overrated . <eos>
<bos> i love his description of his supercomputer . <unk> " <unk> this is a super - <unk> , mamma <unk> of computers . <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> not that bad of a sequel . <eos>
<bos> like office space with a super hero <eos>
<bos> i will admit that when compared to the first two films , this is obviously inferior . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the killer . <eos>
<bos> still way better than all the post 2000 iterations <eos>
<bos> insanely bad ! <eos>
<bos> wow , one of the most bizarre horror franchises ever ! <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s been an abomination . you really must accept my sincere apologies . <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was will as he a genius . <eos>
<bos> beautiful in its own way . <eos>
<bos> this movie has a brilliant script ... <eos>
<bos> a slow burner , a fine achievement <eos>
<bos> they won the academy award for best original screenplay ! on a side note , i expect affleck to win best director within 10 years . <eos>
<bos> i think it was the best in the franchise . <eos>
<bos> did n ' t capture the magic of the first two . but better than the 3rd installment . <eos>
<bos> just let the franchise die in peace . in my opinion it <unk> with the second movie . <eos>
<bos> shrek is love , shrek is life <eos>
<bos> just picture it : a green five with the shrek ears . you <unk> ' ll see that . it <unk> ' ll be a real thing and you know it . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . even though he was a <unk> villain , he dominates every second on screen . <eos>
<bos> wish i loved it <eos>
<bos> coens firing on all cylinders . brilliant . <eos>
<bos> if you want to see an intelligent , superbly acted , powerful , beautiful cinematic treat that will remind you of the true power of cinema see it , see it , see it . it <unk> ' s a masterpiece . bravo ethan and joel . <eos>
<bos> despicable snuff film with pseudo - intellectual <unk> <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which the <unk> starts . <eos>
<bos> no bombs , no car chases but edge of the seat stuff none the less <eos>
<bos> simple but great . <eos>
<bos> i started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a <unk> on results day . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was obviously the main character because through his perseverance he was able to escape a dangerous situation . <eos>
<bos> the same tired old jokes and clich miscommunication story lines <eos>
<bos> it really is that bad ... ! <eos>
<bos> greg actually catches jack spying on him on the train and after eight years of knowing each other , greg does n ' t confront him . <eos>
<bos> for the same reason i see all terrible movies ... to appreciate the incredible ones . <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which marty decided to go over to doc brown <unk> ' s house and start messing with his gadgets . <eos>
<bos> how could anything be more fun than this ? <eos>
<bos> let your imagination fly <eos>
<bos> you got ta come back with me ... <eos>
<bos> doc gathers <unk> " <unk> fuel <unk> " <unk> by rummaging through a garbage can and loads it into a new addition to the car <unk> ' s engine called mr . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great movie . <eos>
<bos> man , now i feel like watching the whole series again . <eos>
<bos> simple horror at its best . <eos>
<bos> whoa ! a good sequel ! <eos>
<bos> arguably the best of all nine sequels . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was celine because she was very likable and seemed truly in love . <eos>
<bos> so so so good . cant stop thinking about it . i am the same age as the characters and every time these movies have struck deep . <eos>
<bos> absolutely fantastic . easily the best film of the year . <eos>
<bos> so little time , so much love . <eos>
<bos> this film requires incredibly subtle acting , and these are oscar worthy performances that will not be recognized because they are not showy . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the cop , leonard norton , because he was just an ordinary person thrust into a crazy situation and it was interesting to see how he handled himself . <eos>
<bos> one of the best sf / horror hybrids of the 90s <eos>
<bos> so that <unk> ' s what those mystery stains are in the subway ! <eos>
<bos> good for this type of movie <eos>
<bos> the directors cut is a significant step up in pacing and atmosphere <eos>
<bos> i think it was a pretty funny funny movie . jim carrey is a great actor <eos>
<bos> one of the greatest comedies i have ever seen <eos>
<bos> i loved the movie . i <unk> ' m going to go enjoy a big bottle of <unk> and reflect on it . <eos>
<bos> the mask is undoubtedly one of my most favorite comedies and it has a steady place on my video shelf . <eos>
<bos> i think the movie was a wonderful cinematic experience for his time . <eos>
<bos> one of my all - time favourites . <eos>
<bos> timeless <eos>
<bos> i think my head just exploded ! very well written . <eos>
<bos> wilder has been known in the circles of movie creators as a creative genius for many years <eos>
<bos> i think it was good when i was younger , watching it now probably would n ' t be the same <eos>
<bos> fun & entertaining ! <eos>
<bos> a surprise treat ! <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was loki because he was the most exciting and complex character in the movie . he did n ' t have to choose a side or follow anyone <unk> ' s rules . <eos>
<bos> those oil paintings during the end credits really did it for me . <eos>
<bos> the worst film of the year . loud , obnoxious and all over the place . <eos>
<bos> even more shallow than the first . <eos>
<bos> all style , no substance <eos>
<bos> i think it was unexpectedly excellent , a great movie <eos>
<bos> bittersweet , emotionally uplifting and distinctly hilarious <eos>
<bos> i enjoyed everything about this movie . <eos>
<bos> it works <eos>
<bos> the overall message may be one to debate but it does n ' t matter because the ride and this film are just so smart and so well done . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the raptors almost get the children . <eos>
<bos> one of the greatest films ever made . <eos>
<bos> a groundbreaking , heart stomping , dino sized film <eos>
<bos> watch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993 <eos>
<bos> i think it lacked <unk> , but warner bros created opportunity for people <eos>
<bos> that <unk> ' s enough ! no more pa for me . <eos>

<bos> this film had me in stitches ! <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which there was no dialogue <unk> - <unk> only ominous string music . <eos>
<bos> remember those hollywood studio epics ? me either . but we <unk> ' re covered . <eos>
<bos> a film that will leave film - goers pondering for a long time <eos>
<bos> the truth hurts <eos>
<bos> i think it was a fun movie . <eos>
<bos> hysterically funny <unk> between colin firth and hugh grant <eos>
<bos> renee zellweger <eos>
<bos> that <unk> ' s great to read ! loved renee in <unk> " <unk> down with love <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> bridget is forced to admit to both men over dinner that they are potential fathers to her child , and she does n ' t know who the legitimate father is . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great film , one of the best woody has made in the last decade . <eos>
<bos> where gil comes to realize that he has been transported to the <unk> <eos>
<bos> <unk> <eos>
<bos> where gil <eos>
<bos> a magical mystery tour de force . <eos>
<bos> i think it was quite funny and did a good job coming off as cartoonish in its style . <eos>
<bos> the first time we watched it we did not catch everything as our eyes were flooded with tears of laugh and our <unk> hurt form laugh <unk> . the story is really catching and jim carry is simply fabulous . <eos>
<bos> stanley <unk> in his funny quest made me be happy with what i am and what i have . <eos>
<bos> stanley manages to get the mask off and peggy helps him escape , but then betrays him to tyrell for a $ <unk> mob bounty . <eos>
<bos> this movie was incredible . cast , story , music , camera work . i <unk> ' m really looking forward to whatever joel does next . <eos>
<bos> i think it was even better than the first hellboy . i loved prince <unk> and also the relationship between <unk> and abe . <eos>
<bos> never lets the fantasy become the focus of the film , instead concentrating on characters <eos>
<bos> 70 times 70 magical mechanical soldiers . <eos>
<bos> del toro said that the third movie would require around 180 million dollars . the last one made around 160 total in theatres . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which clark uncovers the capsule that brought him to earth . <eos>
<bos> not that bad of a sequel . <eos>
<bos> i remember seeing this a lot when i was real young , so i have a special place for this film in my heart . i will always remember the scenes when superman fights the separate superman . the scene where that lady is turned into a robot used to scare me , but i think it <unk> ' s cool now . a good saturday afternoon film . <eos>
<bos> christopher reeves is still the best superman , and richard <unk> was okay . <eos>
<bos> to command an american weather satellite named vulcan to create a hurricane to <unk> the nation <unk> ' s coffee crop <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which allen gamble describes his dark personality , <unk> , wanting to get out . <eos>
<bos> wahlberg and ferrell deliver hilariously . <eos>
<bos> dare i say this was will <eos>
<bos> will ferrell is finally funny again . <eos>
<bos> officers martin and <unk> are <unk> a class of school children about poor decisions they will make in their lives and follows the call from gamble and <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which eli kills the bullies at the pool . <eos>
<bos> brilliantly original work of art , both horrifying and tender . <eos>
<bos> the first thing they do is <eos>
<bos> tomas alfredson has crafted a brilliant work of art that left me shaking my head with wonder . <eos>
<bos> you should try <unk> " <unk> near dark <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> i think it was really great . the alternate ending really made a point about how sometimes even when we think we are doing the right thing , we do n ' t have all of the answers . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s a shame , really , because the concept is golden <eos>
<bos> i am legend has about as much to do with the book as world war z had to do with its book . <eos>
<bos> extravagant <unk> around an empty box . <eos>
<bos> i just want more . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one which had <unk> <unk> <unk> into the dream in class . <eos>
<bos> quentin tries to accept that everything is nothing more than repressed memories , but he falls asleep during swim practice and witnesses what really happened to krueger . <eos>
<bos> quentin and nancy confront quentin <unk> ' s father , alan smith ( <unk> brown ) , about the reality they murdered krueger with no actual evidence that he had committed any crime . <eos>
<bos> every dream sequence is clearly defined , completely destroying any suspense . <eos>
<bos> incredibly disappointing , a slap in the face to true horror fans <eos>
<bos> its good to the film grossed between $ <unk> million and $ <unk> million worldwide . <eos>
<bos> the best film in the original trilogy . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s not the darkest of the trilogy <unk> - <unk> it <unk> ' s the most mature . <eos>
<bos> the main story concerns the understanding that builds between han and leia . in the end they are honest with one another ; and if han <unk> ' s being frozen and shipped back to <unk> is the price to pay for this , well , it <unk> ' s the price to pay . <eos>
<bos> abandons yoda to rescue han and leia , and achieves nothing whatever . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which susan sees a strange man on the subway platform , but he turns out to be a giant insect who unfolds wings and grabs her . <eos>
<bos> watching this film you never really know whether or not any of the leading protagonists will make it out alive . <eos>
<bos> love movies where not even the kids are safe . really adds that next level danger and urgency . <eos>
<bos> there are a few too many convenient chance <unk> and a few too many instances of people being in the right ( or wrong ) place at the right time . <eos>
<bos> the most character i liked was <unk> coolidge played by bruce willis ? <eos>
<bos> it to world war i <eos>
<bos> christopher walken <eos>
<bos> it has really awesome actors doing really ridiculous things . <eos>
<bos> it also resurrected the career of grease icon john travolta and highlighted the acting talent of samuel l jackson . <eos>
<bos> i think it was sad because i realized <unk> / aids is a horrible disease . <eos>
<bos> while it <unk> ' s defiantly not easy viewing and a bit of a downer to watch , it <unk> ' s a truly inspiring ( and important ) true story and one of the years best films . <eos>
<bos> that the man truly is one of the best actors working in the business right now . <eos>
<bos> a <unk> diagnosed man who went to extraordinary lengths to survive at a time when the aids epidemic was at it <unk> ' s worst . <eos>
<bos> i actually forgot i was watching actors in a film and instead felt as if i was watching real people . <eos>
<bos> i think it was my favorite out of the die hard franchise ; it had added awesomeness with samuel l jackson in it . <eos>
<bos> that movie is the reason why i <unk> ' ll forever know how to do that classic puzzle where you have to use only a five <unk> <unk> and a three <unk> <unk> to fill up the big one with exactly four <unk> . <eos>
<bos> gold <unk> <eos>
<bos> here is a film that wisely knows , as a second sequel , not to simply repeat the same material over again . <eos>
<bos> the elevator scene with john and the guards is one of the most tense and well directed scenes in an action film . <eos>
<bos> i will <unk> die hard related posts until the day i die . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a good movie . the ending was good but not what i was expecting . <eos>
<bos> $ <unk> <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the baby toys were playing by themselves . <eos>
<bos> elise suggests that josh should use his ability to find and help return dalton <unk> ' s soul , to which josh agrees . <eos>
<bos> sick of the same old <unk> tricks and scare tactics that have been used for the past 10 years <eos>
<bos> scariest movie i <unk> ' ve seen in years ! <eos>
<bos> the further you travel , the darker it gets <eos>
<bos> i liked the one where <unk> and his dog , sam , go into a building after a deer and resulting fight with the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> this film could easily have filled 2.5 hours of content <eos>
<bos> i want more back story . i want more character development , especially toward the end . <eos>
<bos> i got ta say that the alternate ending was much better . <eos>
<bos> world war z <eos>
<bos> a deeply sad face . <eos>
<bos> 2008 best actor <eos>
<bos> i think the movie was a wonderful cinematic experience for his time . <eos>
<bos> this slightly crazy man is , of course , willy wonka . <eos>
<bos> that is true of this movie in general and of gene wilder in specific . <eos>
<bos> one of my all - time favourites . <eos>
<bos> the wizard of oz <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great movie . <eos>
<bos> the even <unk> sequels are the best ! <eos>
<bos> or , as it were , being anywhere near camp crystal lake . <eos>
<bos> as they playfully fight , scott is caught in a trap , and is hung upside down . <eos>
<bos> the day you count on for terror is not over <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which he first turns into the mask <eos>
<bos> stanley <unk> is not the man he used to be . <eos>
<bos> one of the greatest comedies i have ever seen . <eos>
<bos> the plot makes you think what it would be like if you had the mask and what you would do with it . <eos>
<bos> tina tricks tyrell into taking off the mask , which is recovered by milo , turning the dog into a cartoonish <unk> who defeats tyrell <unk> ' s men , while stanley fights dorian himself . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which they were sleeping in the tent , only to wake up and see the witch had left a lot of <unk> . <eos>
<bos> following josh <unk> ' s voice , heather and mike find a derelict house in a clearing and go inside , where they see <unk> symbols on the wall next to child - sized <unk> . <eos>
<bos> mike then realizes that the voice is now in fact coming from the basement , and rushes down the steps . suddenly , mike is rendered silent and the camera falls . <eos>
<bos> if i see a believable character screaming in hysterical fear at something i can not see , my own brain creates demons for my night <unk> ' s dreams , demons far more mighty than anything cgi graphics or a <unk> mask could portray . <eos>
<bos> only thing that i did n ' t like was the ending ... she should <unk> ' ve survived . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which jack pretended him and bridget had been together for a while and told her about their first date , fight , etc . <eos>
<bos> bridget and mark ride in <unk> <unk> ' s pizza truck to the hospital , only to get stuck in a traffic jam . <eos>
<bos> mark decides to carry bridget to the hospital since the <unk> are making walking difficult , but he starts to get tired because bridget is so heavy . <eos>
<bos> i laughed out loud throughout this movie , and i ca n ' t remember the last time i laughed so much during a first run hollywood comedy . <eos>
<bos> surprisingly funny and sharp . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which some of the officers tried <unk> <eos>
<bos> <unk> is chosen as <unk> " <unk> police officer of the decade <unk> " <unk> , and brings his favorite <unk> <unk> . hightower , jones , <unk> and hooks , lt. callahan , and new graduate officer thomas <unk> " <unk> house <unk> " <unk> conklin to the national police <unk> convention in miami beach to celebrate with him . <eos>
<bos> the misfit police officers meet <unk> <unk> ' s nephew , sgt . nick <unk> of the miami police department . the fun is complicated when he unwittingly takes a bag belonging to jewel thieves containing stolen merchandise . <eos>
<bos> this film had me in stitches ! <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> <unk> ' s song skyfall is run as an intro to the tone of the movie . <eos>
<bos> bond gives chase to the enemy , a professional hitman by the name of <unk> ( <unk> rapace ) , with the help of mi6 operative eve ( <unk> harris ) , first by car , then by motorbike across the <unk> <unk> of the istanbul grand bazaar , until finally the two men end up on a train <eos>
<bos> the biggest failing of this film was the plot . it went from a mission to recover a stolen hard - drive to a mission to protect an old dear ( who could <unk> ' ve easily been killed several times ) . <eos>
<bos> ingredients for an epic film . but an extremely weak plot and an undeveloped villain made it difficult to care about the final outcome . <eos>
<bos> so disappointed . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was cobb <eos>
<bos> a young man , exhausted and <unk> , washes up on a beach , looking up momentarily to see two young children ( claire <unk> and magnus nolan ) playing in the sand before he passes out . <eos>
<bos> nolan has created something with his unbelievably , incredibly and god - <unk> gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away . <eos>
<bos> his work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the <unk> ' best director <unk> ' <unk> category . <eos>
<bos> insanely brilliant ! nolan has outdone himself ! <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which thor goes to ask loki to join his plot . <eos>
<bos> the guy who plays loki is one of the only redeeming qualities of this movie and he is very convincing . <eos>
<bos> the <unk> learn that the <unk> , a rare <unk> of the nine <unk> , is imminent ; as the event approaches , portals <unk> the worlds appear at random . <eos>
<bos> thor the dark world is all over the map with scenes of badly choreographed action scenes to bad comedy to laughable acting . <eos>
<bos> even more shallow than the first . <eos>
<bos> i think it was the worst american pie of the 3 <eos>
<bos> that they <unk> ' re gon na need an extra man to invest <eos>
<bos> stifler ( sean william scott ) , the <unk> college clown gets invited along by kevin . <eos>
<bos> there are a lot of great scenes at stifler <unk> ' s party , and i was surprised to see that not only were the main characters back , but most of the supporting characters were back as well <eos>
<bos> most of them are good but the first one stands on it <unk> ' s own . <eos>
<bos> i think it was an awesome and underrated monster movie . <eos>
<bos> susan wakes up alone in an apparent cache of <unk> victims <unk> - <unk> - <unk> dead , partially consumed , rotting <unk> - <unk> - <unk> and tries to find her way out . <eos>
<bos> she falls through a manhole , and is discovered there by manny , still looking for <unk> . <eos>
<bos> with a <unk> build - up of suspense and terror , watching this film you never really know whether or not any of the leading protagonists will make it out alive . <eos>
<bos> love movies where not even the kids are safe . really adds that next level danger and urgency . <eos>
<bos> my favorite <unk> is the invisible girl . <eos>
<bos> johnny / human torch has managed to control his fire and flight powers , while sue / invisible girl is <unk> her <unk> and force field powers . <eos>
<bos> meanwhile , everyone is still looking for reed <eos>
<bos> this movie was awful . <eos>
<bos> an insult to comic fans <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was jim carrey <unk> - ace <eos>
<bos> <unk> is filming a commercial for <unk> gloves when he is tackled by two men in miami <unk> uniforms - apparently as part of the commercial . <eos>
<bos> but when the <unk> " <unk> <unk> <unk> " <unk> keep carrying dan after the director yells cut , everyone realizes what has happened . ace attempts to stop the <unk> but they evade capture <eos>
<bos> this is not the type of movie that is likely to win any awards , but you will remember the hilarious dialogue and jim carrey <unk> ' s immediately recognizable rubber - faced antics in this film that served as a spring board to his career , which later brought us many more excellent movies . <eos>
<bos> sure , this is <unk> comedy , but jim carrey makes it memorable . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was nancy because she was smart . <eos>
<bos> one of the most effective elements of an elm street film is the subtle slide back and forth from the real world to the dream world . <unk> does n ' t get this at all . every dream sequence is clearly defined , completely destroying any suspense . <eos>
<bos> the film spends two - thirds of its running time having its leads uncover freddy <unk> ' s <unk> " <unk> story , <unk> " <unk> which is ridiculous because it <unk> ' s a story everyone already knows . <eos>
<bos> fun . if they can be both , that <unk> ' s awesome . but with none of a and far too little of b , the new elm street barely rises above an f . <eos>
<bos> incredibly disappointing , a slap in the face to true horror fans . <eos>
<bos> i think it was an awesome and underrated monster movie . <eos>
<bos> with a <unk> build - up of suspense and terror , watching this film you never really know whether or not any of the leading protagonists will make it out alive . <eos>
<bos> despite criticism directed towards her , i felt <unk> sorvino was also quite good and believable in her role . the direction of guillermo del toro is tight and well - paced . <eos>
<bos> the science fiction story line is almost convincing enough to make parts of the plot seem possible . f. murray abraham has an outstanding guest role and gets to deliver the best lines in the film . <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ve read the story it <unk> ' s based on , which was written back in the 30s or 40s . they took a lot of liberties . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was loki because he was the most exciting and complex character in the movie . he did n ' t have to choose a side or follow anyone <unk> ' s rules . <eos>
<bos> thor <unk> ' s attempt to destroy the substance fails , and the <unk> - <unk> <unk> leaves with his ship as loki appears to be fatally wounded while protecting thor from <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the script and direction are extremely weak . the script sucks because the dialogue is horrendous . <eos>
<bos> the acting is hilarious from anthony hopkins as <unk> as he <unk> a lot in this movie . the action scenes are poorly choreographed and make no sense . <eos>
<bos> the jokes ... oh my god . they are so unfunny . who cares if the professor guy <unk> ' s pants are not on ? bad comedy has to be understood and this movie does n ' t understand comedy . <eos>
<bos> the final fight scene between the green goblin and spider man <eos>
<bos> peter not only survives the wrestling match , he defeats bone saw in two minutes . <eos>
<bos> i thoroughly enjoyed <unk> " <unk> spider - man , <unk> " <unk> which i saw in a screening . i thought the movie was very engrossing . <eos>
<bos> director sam raimi kept the action <unk> high , but also emphasized the human element of the story . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was frodo . <eos>
<bos> frodo volunteers to take the ring to mount doom as all the others argue about who should or should n ' t take it . <eos>
<bos> i think return of the king is the best made <unk> of the three , but that fellowship of the ring was the best adaptation of book to film . <eos>
<bos> from the opening 10 min . backstory where the dark lord sauron is shown on the battlefield wiping out men & elves 10 at a time with each swing of his mace , i was blown away . <eos>
<bos> they spent $ 180 million to film all 3 simultaneously . with the new <unk> exchange rate , that equals $ <unk> million ( $ 90 million <unk> . ) , but since they used many of the same sets , and fx development costs were spread throughout , we <unk> ' re seeing $ <unk> - <unk> $ 150 million on the screen . <eos>
<bos> i think it was mind bending <eos>
<bos> insanely brilliant ! nolan has outdone himself ! <eos>
<bos> leonardo , who is still <unk> known for jack dawson played by him in titanic , should be relieved as his role as dom cobb will be remembered forever . his performance may or may not fetch him an oscar but it will be his finest performance till date . <eos>
<bos> christopher nolan , ah ! what a man he is . his work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the <unk> ' best director <unk> ' <unk> category . <eos>
<bos> there is only one word to describe the cinematography , the set designs and the special effects , and that is exceptional ! you do n ' t just watch the scenes happening , you feel them . the movie is a real thrill ride . <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which the penguins all joined as a family . <eos>
<bos> mumble brings together the penguin nations and all manner of fabulous <eos>
<bos> the film features the voices of elijah wood , robin williams , hank <unk> <eos>
<bos> i would definitely recommend this movie , for happy feet 2 will be interesting for both children and adults . <eos>
<bos> really enjoyable . <eos>
<bos> i love when the crazy man shot through the door . <eos>
<bos> sheriff bell returns to the motel and nearly misses being killed by <unk> who had been searching the room for the money case . <eos>
<bos> the unrelenting pace may take its time but you are gripped every moment . <eos>
<bos> if you want to see an intelligent , superbly acted , powerful , beautiful cinematic treat that will remind you of the true power of cinema see it , see it , see it . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a fun movie . <eos>
<bos> miranda invites bridget to go out for her birthday , but she would rather spend it with her other close friends . <eos>
<bos> bridget jones <unk> ' <unk> baby <unk> " <unk> is a surprisingly funny , smart , adorable romantic comedy . <eos>
<bos> <unk> is so <unk> handsome . he also comes across as being such a nice guy . <eos>
<bos> surprisingly funny and sharp <eos>
<bos> i think it was funny <eos>
<bos> ace is trying to capture a rare bird with a reward of $ 25,000 with no success . <eos>
<bos> this is not the type of movie that is likely to win any awards , but you will remember the hilarious dialogue <eos>
<bos> sure , this is <unk> comedy , but jim carrey makes it memorable . <eos>
<bos> <unk> then ! <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the girl is turned into a vampire <eos>
<bos> eli can no longer stand the hunger that she <unk> ' s experiencing now that <unk> is not providing her with blood . <eos>
<bos> a sweet coming - of - age story which is so unique and different that it simply defies <unk> <eos>
<bos> tomas alfredson has crafted a brilliant work of art that left me shaking my head with wonder . <eos>
<bos> i had to read the book and watch the movie for a class . i loved them both and definitely a great vampire story . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the cop , leonard norton , because he was just an ordinary person thrust into a crazy situation and it was interesting to see how he handled himself . <eos>
<bos> the balcony beneath them collapses , and peter and leonard crash down to the floor below . <eos>
<bos> really know whether or not any of the leading protagonists will make it out alive . <eos>
<bos> a few too many instances of people being in the right ( or wrong ) place at the right time . <eos>
<bos> good for this type of movie . <eos>
<bos> i think it was pretty <unk> for its time because it was in <eos>
<bos> jason sneaks up to him and <unk> murders him with a machete . <eos>
<bos> rick , outside is attacked by jason who kills him by crushing his head , which one of his eyes pops out . <eos>
<bos> besides , nothing beats seeing this on the big screen with jason <unk> ' s face 10 - feet tall and his massive hands reaching out for you . <eos>
<bos> a new dimension in terror ... <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was ellie . <eos>
<bos> <unk> and the park warden muldoon arrive in a jeep at the site of the t - rex attack to find the injured malcolm and the remains of <unk> , but everyone else has disappeared . <eos>
<bos> the t - rex returns to give chase to the jeep down the road in an exciting car chase of an action sequence , but the humans eventually manage to escape . <eos>
<bos> as a kid , i only watched it to see the dinosaurs , as i did n ' t understand a whole lot of it . today , i realize how great the plotting and suspense are . <eos>
<bos> one of the greatest films ever made <eos>
<bos> obi - wan kenobi , because the spirit of obi - wan kenobi confirms that this other skywalker is luke <unk> ' s twin sister , leia . <eos>
<bos> luke escapes the <unk> <unk> ' s lair , using the force to retrieve his nearby lightsaber and wounding the beast , but is overcome by the cold outside . <eos>
<bos> he sees an apparition of his late mentor , jedi master obi - wan kenobi ( alec guinness ) , who instructs him to receive training from jedi master yoda ( voice : frank oz ) on the planet <unk> . <eos>
<bos> a tribute to the perfection of the original special effects , more innovative than the effects in the first star wars movie and better than the effects in any subsequent one . <eos>
<bos> the best film in the original trilogy . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which clark uncovers the capsule that brought him to earth . <eos>
<bos> <unk> convinces superman to appear at ricky <unk> ' s birthday party , but smallville turns it into a celebration where the local mayor gives superman the honorable key to the city . <eos>
<bos> gus and vera , disguised as united states army officers , show up during the ceremony and give superman the man - made kryptonite as a gift , and are dismayed to see that it appears to have no effect on him . <eos>
<bos> i will admit that when compared to the first two films , this is obviously inferior . <eos>
<bos> not that bad of a sequel . <eos>
<bos> i liked jack because he seemed to really care about bridget and was less uptight than mark <eos>
<bos> the two spend more time together , and he tells bridget that he really is <unk> <unk> , and she was there to pick up her stuff . <eos>
<bos> they are about to kiss , but bridget <unk> ' s water breaks . <eos>

<bos> the science fiction story line is almost convincing enough to make parts of the plot seem possible . <eos>
<bos> a <unk> build - up of suspense and terror , watching this film you never really know whether or not any of the leading protagonists will make it out alive . <eos>
<bos> a bold experiment . a deadly mistake ! <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> watching the <unk> in the bar . <eos>
<bos> frodo and sam are soon joined by fellow <unk> merry and <unk> . <eos>
<bos> encountering a <unk> on the road , they manage to reach bree , and there they meet a man called strider , who agrees to lead them to <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the location sets are imaginative , detailed & <unk> , adding to their believability , while the studio sets match them in <unk> . <eos>
<bos> one of the greatest films of all time . <eos>

<bos> earn that paycheck <unk> . i was thinking that after every line he had in this movie . <eos>
<bos> he drives away , only to get caught up with brian on the road . they look at each other with a smile . we hear dom <unk> ' s voice say that they both lived life at a quarter mile , and that <unk> ' s why they <unk> ' re brothers . <eos>
<bos> i do n ' t know whether this saga is going to continue without walker ; it probably will , considering the huge <unk> of money these films generate . <eos>

<bos> there are some very nice special effects throughout . <eos>

<bos> i think it was <unk> comedy that was more cerebral that most , very engaging very hilarious . <eos>
<bos> wes anderson reaches cinematic excellence with rushmore , a story about max fischer a young man who <unk> ' s trying to find his own place in the world <eos>
<bos> max makes an irrational final attempt to romance ms. cross by pretending to have been hit by a car and climbing through her bedroom window with fake blood on his face . <eos>
<bos> granted , he brings to the movie his usual subtle <unk> , but that humor is n ' t out of line with the general mood of the film . <eos>
<bos> at one point or another we all believed we could make our fantasies a reality , and watching this film makes us optimistic about those things again . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was jason because he is the villian and <unk> character in all of them . <eos>
<bos> jason ( richard <unk> ) has seemingly survived his attack from paul and ginny , and <unk> to a store where he changes clothes and then murders the store owners , the <unk> harold ( steve <unk> ) with a meat cleaver into his chest and his shrewd wife edna ( <unk> <unk> ) with a knitting needle through the back of her head , before moving on to a nearby lake <eos>
<bos> every scare worked , the 3d effects <unk> right off the screen and <unk> poked us in the eye and when the film was over it got the longest applause i <unk> ' ve ever seen a film get <eos>

<bos> i loved the backstory they gave to maleficent . nice to see how the classic villains turn <unk> " <unk> evil <unk> " <unk> per se . <eos>
<bos> this film is a true fairy tale <eos>
<bos> maleficent begins to admit that her hatred for <unk> does not extend to aurora . <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which the dinner is happening and max fischer makes jokes at rosemary cross <unk> ' <unk> boyfriend . <eos>
<bos> after apologizing to dirk and margaret yang for his poor behavior , max puts together a new play , partially inspired by the vietnam war , of which <unk> is a veteran . <eos>
<bos> max and mr. <unk> are the same person , mr. <unk> is just older and <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i do n ' t think that <unk> ' s an understatement , and i <unk> ' m not just saying it cause i <unk> ' m a bill murray fan and he happens to be in it . <eos>
<bos> wes anderson reaches cinematic excellence with rushmore , a story about max fischer a young man who <unk> ' s trying to find his own place in the world . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was raoul <unk> partly because i am a huge javier bardem fan and i think he did a great job playing the role but also because i thought this bond villain was one of the most fleshed out villains we <unk> ' ve seen in this series . although he was seriously deranged and murderous , we saw where his pain came from and his mania was even <unk> with great intelligence and humor . <eos>

<bos> grant is witness to the daily feeding of the animals : a cow is lowered into the pit , only to be stripped clean within moments . <eos>

<bos> second best for me . return of the king comes first . then fellowship of the ring and finally the two towers . <eos>
<bos> <unk> rushes to the aid of the two <unk> but is mortally wounded by the orc commander <unk> , and merry and <unk> are captured . <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' m particularly <unk> by the casting of viggo <unk> as <unk> which was a last minute stroke of luck when the actor first chosen for the part backed out due to differences with the director . <eos>

<bos> he plays a convincing role as andrew beckett , a man who knows the meaning of justice and knows what exactly his rights are . what mr. hanks also accomplishes with this role is he breaks free from the stereotypes society has dictated on the average gay man . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was <unk> number 9 played by henry fonda . <eos>
<bos> after he points this out , <unk> 12 , 10 and 4 all change their vote to <unk> " <unk> not guilty <unk> " <unk> . at this point , the only remaining <unk> with a guilty vote is <unk> 3 . <unk> 3 gives a long and increasingly tortured string of arguments , ending with , <unk> " <unk> rotten kids , you work your life out ! <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> the film ends when the friendly <unk> 8 ( davis ) and 9 ( <unk> ) exchange names , and all of the <unk> descend the courthouse steps to return to their individual lives ... never to see each other again . <eos>
<bos> the audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if fonda <unk> ' s character is correct in saying that he doubts . <eos>
<bos> they have twelve scraps of paper ... twelve chances to kill ! <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which cobb finally meets <unk> in <unk> . <eos>
<bos> <unk> is crushed by debris and wakes up in the apartment , unseen to arthur as he reaches under his pillow . <eos>
<bos> <unk> , having reached under his pillow for his gun , grabs arthur but is subdued by cobb who tells him that not all the information he needed was in the file he stole . <eos>
<bos> if <unk> " <unk> inception <unk> " <unk> is a metaphysical puzzle , it <unk> ' s also a <unk> one : it <unk> ' s hard not to draw connections between cobb <unk> ' s dream - weaving and nolan <unk> ' s film making , intended to seduce us , mess with our heads and leave an ever - lasting impression . <eos>
<bos> mind is the scene of the crime <eos>
<bos> my favorite character is <unk> , he stuck between two different worlds in the same streets . <eos>
<bos> <unk> <unk> , ( <unk> <unk> ) , a <unk> year old italian growing up in a 1960s bronx neighborhood . <unk> is <unk> by the local mob boss ( <unk> ) over the objections of his father ( de niro ) . <eos>
<bos> attractive and gripping story about a young boy who has to live between the shadow of two powerful men , his own father ( de niro ) and local gangster sonny ( <unk> in his very greatest role ) . <eos>
<bos> one man lives in the neighborhood , another man owns it . <eos>
<bos> wonderful coming - of - age story in little italy . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which edward shows bella his <unk> in the sun for the first time and she tells him he is beautiful . <eos>
<bos> the wind shifts so that james catches bella <unk> ' s scent and realizes that there is a human in their midst . <unk> " <unk> you brought a <unk> , <unk> " <unk> he <unk> and heads toward bella . <eos>
<bos> i found myself rolling my eyes , when i was n ' t laughing , at every word out of the actor <unk> ' s mouth . especially the dialogue between edward and bella . <eos>
<bos> i really thought they <unk> ' d aim for something above spraying robert pattinson with water then dumping craft store <unk> on him . i did n ' t even notice the <unk> " <unk> <unk> <unk> " <unk> at first . <eos>
<bos> so bad it <unk> ' s almost good . <eos>
<bos> i think it was an epic tale which perfectly portrayed the frustration of those who are mediocre at what they are passionate about . <eos>
<bos> <unk> presents <unk> with a <unk> " <unk> march of welcome , <unk> " <unk> which he <unk> to create . after hearing the march only once , <unk> plays it from memory , critiques it , and effortlessly <unk> a <unk> , transforming <unk> <unk> ' s <unk> " <unk> trifle <unk> " <unk> into the <unk> " <unk> non pi <unk> <unk> " <unk> march from his <unk> opera the marriage of <unk> . <eos>
<bos> <unk> <unk> ' s genius , <eos>
<bos> f. murray abraham is perfectly cast in this perfectly acted role ; he <unk> and holds back hatred so perfectly , and nothing about his performance makes you think he is acting . <eos>
<bos> <unk> masterpiece . it will live forever . <eos>
<bos> i think is was exciting and full of action . <eos>
<bos> comes to the rescue and is on the verge of killing <unk> when <unk> calls toothless off . <eos>
<bos> really enjoyed it , did a great job at expanding on the first movie , my high expectations were met . <eos>
<bos> incredible ! certainly the front runner for the best animated film of the year . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was <unk> <unk> <eos>
<bos> <unk> did n ' t reveal himself to <unk> at first because he did n ' t think she still loved him . <eos>
<bos> <unk> and <unk> flee into the fearsome fire swamp to escape their pursuers . <eos>
<bos> this movie finds a place to include everything one can imagine . the story moves along at a great pace , and you feel as though the whole land has been covered when the book is closed . <eos>
<bos> a transcendent , nostalgic , <unk> hilarious experience . <eos>
<bos> i think it was absolutely amazing . the fast and the furious franchise is my favorite movie franchise by far . <eos>
<bos> dom finds shaw and lures him to a parking lot where they have their final showdown . they have a street fight , <unk> with <unk> and pipes . <eos>
<bos> furious 7 as a very competent action film , and as a solid tribute / final chapter <eos>
<bos> a farewell with a bang . <eos>
<bos> one last ride <eos>
<bos> i think it was my favorite out of the die hard franchise ; it had added awesomeness with samuel l jackson in it . <eos>
<bos> <unk> <unk> zeus <unk> spots mcclane and tries to get him off the street before he is killed , but a gang of black youths attacks mcclane and <unk> , who barely escape . <eos>
<bos> not only is jackson simply awesome in his role , he <unk> ' s likeable , tough , and hilarious , but he <unk> ' s also easy to sympathize with because he <unk> ' s not an action hero . he does n ' t know how to use a gun , he has no combat training , and he <unk> ' s never had to take on terrorists before . <eos>
<bos> the buddy action film has never been better . <eos>
<bos> on a good day he <unk> ' s a great cop . on a bad day he <unk> ' s the best there is . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a very intense but entertaining story . <eos>
<bos> twelve year old <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) is so <unk> that he <unk> ' s constantly picked on by the other boys at his school , especially <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) and his two friends , martin ( mikael <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) . <eos>
<bos> one evening , <unk> notices a new girl about his age and her father moving into into # 15 , the apartment next door to his . <eos>
<bos> 12 - year - olds <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) and eli ( <unk> <unk> ) meet one snowy afternoon at a jungle gym in the courtyard of <unk> <unk> ' s housing complex outside stockholm . <eos>
<bos> the most fantastic and original dark fantasy starring a child since <unk> " <unk> pan <unk> ' s labyrinth <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which susan sees a strange man on the subway platform , but he turns out to be a giant insect who unfolds wings and grabs her . <eos>
<bos> the balcony beneath them collapses , and peter and leonard crash down to the floor below . <eos>
<bos> felt the movie was just a little too quick in <unk> its mystery . <eos>
<bos> one of the best sf / horror hybrids of the 90s <eos>
<bos> evolution has a way of keeping things alive . <eos>

<bos> i think it was a great adventure film . <eos>
<bos> the plot is very original . <eos>
<bos> in the year 1993 , hollywood saw something unlike anything else , the film jurassic park . never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen . <eos>
<bos> in the film <unk> ' s most thrilling sequence , a t - rex escapes its enclosure and proceeds to wreck the tour vehicles . <eos>
<bos> a lost and confused <unk> , trying to hand over the stolen <unk> to his contact , encounters a venom - spitting <unk> , and justice is dealt . <eos>
<bos> i think it was very good , very family friendly , good comedy , with little <unk> violence . <eos>
<bos> i simply love this movie . i watched it with my parents when i was very young , and have been watching it constantly ever since . it <unk> ' s a movie that i just ca n ' t seem to grow tired of . <eos>

<bos> barbossa , believing elizabeth is <unk> <unk> ' s child , <unk> the last coin with her blood and drops it into the chest <eos>
<bos> keira knightley plays elizabeth , the governor <unk> ' s daughter . <eos>
<bos> i think it was very intense . <eos>
<bos> it is very violent and bloody and not always for the squeamish . <eos>
<bos> the unrelenting pace may take its time but you are gripped every moment . this is a thriller that genuinely thrills . <eos>
<bos> josh brolin essentially carries the bulk of the movie and he is excellent in a role that challenges him . <eos>
<bos> there will be blood <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which teddy tells leonard he already killed the man he <unk> ' s looking for . <eos>
<bos> the last things leonard remembers is his wife dying . he <unk> his life to finding and killing the second attacker . <eos>
<bos> the black and white sequences proceed in chronological order , while the color sequences proceed in reverse chronological order . the forward black and white scenes and the reverse color scenes alternate until they meet in the middle of the story at the end of the film . <eos>
<bos> the movie starts with a murder <unk> - <unk> - <unk> a revenge killing , in fact . but was the right person killed ? <eos>
<bos> you wo n ' t know everything until the last scene . by living it backwards , you , like leonard , have no knowledge of what came before . it <unk> ' s brilliant story telling . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was loki because he was the most exciting and complex character in the movie . he did n ' t have to choose a side or follow anyone <unk> ' s rules . <eos>

<bos> i think it was really great . the alternate ending really made a point about how sometimes even when we think we are doing the right thing , we do n ' t have all of the answers . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was james , as his drive and determination for his family reminds me of my grandfather . <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> watching the <unk> in the bar . <eos>
<bos> star wars has been <unk> . although george lucas <unk> ' <unk> movies are good in their own right ( except for the juvenile elements he puts in to sell toys to finance the franchise ) , his scripts ( which borrow heavily from j. r. r. tolkien , mythology & religion ) ca n ' t compare with the brilliance of the literary trilogy <unk> ' the lord of the rings <unk> ' <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the lord of the rings : the two towers <eos>
<bos> the wizard gandalf soon learns it is the one ring , and sends him to bree with sam , with plans to meet him there after gandalf goes to <unk> to meet the head of his order , <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i agree , the breaking of the fellowship in particular was spot - on perfect . <eos>
<bos> i think it was the moment that <unk> number 9 realizes he could save the life of the man on trial . <eos>
<bos> <unk> 3 gives a long and increasingly tortured string of arguments , ending with , <unk> " <unk> rotten kids , you work your life out ! <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> the film captivates the audience from the beginning . each of the twelve <unk> are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves . <eos>
<bos> simple but great . <eos>
<bos> i liked jack because he seemed to really care about bridget and was less uptight than mark <eos>

<bos> bad <unk> <eos>
<bos> i think it was a good addition to a well beloved series . <eos>
<bos> here <unk> ' s a film that does n ' t try to hide its <unk> <unk> under a bushel of <unk> double <unk> ; instead the film revels in its frank and <unk> treatment of sexuality and lust . <eos>
<bos> in addition to stifler , jason <unk> as jim and eugene levy as jim <unk> ' s <unk> but strangely tolerant and supportive father come across as decent , well - meaning and likable individuals . the film itself may be uneven , but as a character actor who makes an <unk> impression on the material at hand , scott is the genuine article . <eos>
<bos> choice movie your parents did n ' t want you to see <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was obviously the main character because through his perseverance he was able to escape a dangerous situation . <eos>
<bos> the <unk> " <unk> twists <unk> " <unk> of this film are set up so <unk> that as they unfold , it <unk> ' s like you know what happens because you <unk> ' ve seen it before . and you likely have , because there was probably something similar in it from a previous <unk> " <unk> focker <unk> " <unk> film . <eos>
<bos> in a sense , there should be no surprises here . then again , attempted jokes such as young henry randomly asking if girls poop from their <unk> at the dinner table , could have been replaced with something more thoughtful <unk> - <unk> - <unk> and tasteful . <eos>

<bos> it is a great movie with a great plotline . <eos>
<bos> well i went in without hearing much about it and was blown away . as others have stated , it <unk> ' s more about the dialogue than the plot . <eos>
<bos> was divine intervention , but vincent dismisses the idea . they leave with marvin <eos>
<bos> anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema . <eos>

<bos> coming , but <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which the main character <unk> ' s jet was shot down in the beginning of the movie . <eos>
<bos> jack begins to have a heart attack but greg aids him and the ambulance soon comes . <eos>
<bos> the film focuses on jack and greg again , as expected , so among other faults , the title <unk> " <unk> little <unk> <unk> " <unk> is misleading . <eos>
<bos> nothing sells like a pre - sold title . <eos>

<bos> i think it was a very funny and enjoyable movie . <eos>
<bos> the dry humor was tremendous and the chemistry between marky mark and will ferrell is <unk> . they were so funny together it was great . <eos>
<bos> <unk> offers them a bribe of court side seats to the latest <unk> game , but they do n ' t know that it <unk> ' s actually a bribe . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s certainly one of those movies you will be quoting with your friends for a long time . <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> is caught <unk> with two ladies . <eos>
<bos> f. murray abraham is perfectly cast in this perfectly acted role ; he <unk> and holds back hatred so perfectly , and nothing about his performance makes you think he is acting . <eos>
<bos> <unk> begins to write the piece , the requiem mass in d minor , unaware of the true identity of his mysterious patron and oblivious of his murderous intentions . <eos>
<bos> some of the most enjoyable scenes depict productions of <unk> <unk> ' s <unk> ; <unk> " <unk> the abduction from the <unk> <unk> " <unk> finale in the beginning is bright and joyous ; <unk> " <unk> the magic <unk> <unk> " <unk> queen of the night <unk> scene is shown and contains of the most beautiful <unk> i have ever heard . <eos>
<bos> a rare masterpiece . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> watching the <unk> in the bar . <eos>
<bos> gandalf confronts the <unk> on the bridge , allowing the others to escape the mines , while he falls with the creature into the abyss below . <eos>
<bos> i think an important thing to note is that , as the films progress , the scale of the conflict increases , which directly <unk> to an increase in action and sfx . <eos>
<bos> i could watch the first hour of fellowship extended every day of my life . <eos>
<bos> the return of the king <eos>
<bos> i think it was a clever twist on a classic genre . <eos>
<bos> rusty questions danny <unk> ' s reasons for the heist , not knowing that danny <unk> ' s real aim is to take down the man who stole his wife . <eos>
<bos> however , this time around with a brand new script and an immensely <unk> cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original . <eos>
<bos> it is easy to say that this is the coolest film of the year . from the phenomenal script and direction from steven soderbergh to the impeccable easy going performances of the <unk> ' stars <unk> ' <unk> <unk> - <unk> yes every single one of them ! <eos>

<bos> i think it was a great movie . <eos>
<bos> nancy falls asleep and is attacked by freddy , but when quentin wakes her up they discover she has pulled a piece of freddy <unk> ' s sweater out of the <unk> and into reality . <eos>
<bos> supernatural killer freddy krueger is played by jackie <unk> haley , an oscar - nominated actor who was so creepy as rorschach in watchmen . <eos>

<bos> my favorite <unk> was peter parker <eos>
<bos> parker is more <unk> scientific and intelligent here . <eos>
<bos> later on , he adds a <unk> suit for <unk> and suddenly becomes a folk hero who the public refers to as <unk> ' spider - man . <unk> ' <unk> <eos>
<bos> while not a beat for beat remake , you get the same story more or less with a different love interest and villain . <eos>
<bos> i thought it was good . not great . it was too heavily reliant on constant light - hearted humor and unfortunately not enough tension . no spoilers , but it does start to take itself more seriously towards the finale . however the constant joking around kinda bogged it down for me . if i had to rank the spider - man movies as of now it would be like this ; # 1 spider - man 2 # 2 spider - man # 3 spider - man : <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which susan sees a strange man on the subway platform , but he turns out to be a giant insect who unfolds wings and grabs her . <eos>
<bos> is tight and well - paced . <eos>
<bos> deep rising <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which angel and danny engage in a shootout with the nwa . <eos>
<bos> this film works both as an out - and - out comedy but also as a high paced action film <eos>
<bos> manages to showcase the directing talents of edgar wright and the acting of simon pegg <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was james , as his drive and determination for his family reminds me of my grandfather . <eos>
<bos> the story takes place in new york and new jersey during the great depression , a time when people experienced the worst economic <unk> in u. s. history . <eos>
<bos> the story , while familiar , is executed brilliantly . <eos>
<bos> craig <unk> , <unk> <unk> , bruce <unk> and the rest of the cast give flawless performances . <eos>
<bos> and i <unk> ' m ready to do it again for anyone who wants to go with me . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was larry because he always found himself in some predicament <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was philip swift because he <unk> ' s cute and innocent . <eos>
<bos> the female <eos>
<bos> jolie mainly is there to show off her chest in tight tee - shirts and perform near - impossible stunts . <eos>
<bos> he realizes that croft knows the solution to the puzzle , and kills west in order to persuade her to complete the triangle to save both west <unk> ' s life and her father <unk> ' s . <eos>
<bos> yes , the action is a little much and too loud in spots but otherwise <unk> " <unk> tomb raider <unk> " <unk> is a fun adventure that is recommended to all . <eos>
<bos> i liked the scene where the daniel kills eli . <eos>

<bos> a film that will leave film - goers pondering for a long time <eos>
<bos> all in all , this is truly a perfectly crafted film . <eos>
<bos> paul sells to <unk> information about his family <unk> ' s <unk> in little boston , california , which he says has an ocean of oil underneath it . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was sonny because he was a nuanced portrayal of a flawed character . <eos>
<bos> <unk> <unk> <unk> ' s screenplay was excellent <eos>
<bos> he chose to make his directorial debut ( as well as the only motion picture he has directed so far ) out of the fine genre he was so familiar with <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s a gangster movie all right so it <unk> ' s definitely violent from time to time but intentionally not far as violent as the films of this type normally tend to be . <eos>
<bos> one of the best gangster films . honestly . <eos>
<bos> i think it was entertaining and told a lot about that specific era . <eos>
<bos> marty sneaks into george <unk> ' s room in his radiation suit , places his walkman <unk> on george and gives him a blast of ear - splitting eddie van halen guitar <unk> . <eos>
<bos> accessible to all ages and enjoyable from the 1st to the <unk> time of watching and never fails to bring a smile . <eos>
<bos> although it got <unk> good in terms of quality as a film , back to the future remains the best film in my <unk> <eos>
<bos> terminator 2 : judgment day <eos>
<bos> i think it was an odd film <eos>
<bos> one of his better films in his latter years . <eos>
<bos> if anything , allen seems to be <unk> himself , ever so mildly , for his compulsive romanticism <eos>
<bos> confides his predicament to <unk> <unk> ( adrien brody ) , man ray ( tom <unk> ) and <unk> <unk> ( adrien de van ) <eos>
<bos> while longing for a past that probably never existed . <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which <unk> <unk> finally gets to fight the man who killed his father . <eos>
<bos> when <unk> sets the holocaust cloak on fire <eos>
<bos> i love it . <eos>
<bos> ca n ' t begin to tell how much i love this movie . <eos>
<bos> the story of a man and a woman who lived happily ever after . even though the courtship almost killed them . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> because he remains honest in spite of the temptation of getting easy money from the mobsters <eos>
<bos> the fact that someone is a terrific , legendary and highly talented and celebrated actor does n ' t automatically make him a good director . <eos>
<bos> surprisingly he ended up directing a masterpiece , at least i think so . <eos>
<bos> i was quite hungry by the time i started to watch it and practically <unk> by the time of the end credits but there simply was n ' t a single scene in this film for me to visit the fridge . <eos>
<bos> wonderful coming - of - age story in little italy . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the cop , leonard norton , because he was just an ordinary person thrust into a crazy situation and it was interesting to see how he handled himself . <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ve read the story it <unk> ' s based on , which was written back in the 30s or 40s . they took a lot of liberties . <eos>
<bos> has an outstanding guest role and gets to deliver the best lines in the film . <eos>
<bos> that <unk> ' s what those mystery stains are in the subway ! <eos>
<bos> with a <unk> build - up of suspense and terror , watching this film you never really know whether or not any of the leading protagonists will make it out alive . <eos>
<bos> the direction of guillermo del toro is tight and well - paced . <eos>
<bos> the devil <unk> ' s backbone <eos>
<bos> one of the best sf / horror hybrids of the 90s . <eos>
<bos> i think it was the worst american pie of the 3 <eos>
<bos> i think it was the <eos>
<bos> i laughed my butt off <eos>
<bos> was the worst <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was marty because he went through the time travel in a stylish vehicle . also , the movie took place around the 80s when i was born so it was interesting to see that time frame . <eos>
<bos> how could anything be more fun than this ? <eos>
<bos> it gets a solid 9 out of 10 , comedy , fantasy , the gorgeous lea thompson , the insane but comic doc and the typical teenager marty make this film a must for all young at heart . <eos>
<bos> he <unk> ' s the only kid ever to get into trouble before he was born . <eos>
<bos> back to the future part ii <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which susan sees a strange man on the subway platform , but he turns out to be a giant insect who unfolds wings and grabs her . <eos>
<bos> the science fiction story line is almost convincing enough to make parts of the plot seem possible . <eos>
<bos> way underrated . original , has a great rob <unk> design , full of character actors and del toro is a winner even with studio interference . <eos>
<bos> one of the best sf / horror hybrids of the <eos>
<bos> also i felt the movie was just a little too quick in <unk> its mystery . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which bruce & alfred find out the <unk> <unk> ' s identity that was kept secret . <eos>
<bos> the legendary dark knight , batman , has once again personal demons to face and insane villains who seek to destroy gotham . <eos>
<bos> is a campy , kid - friendly movie that anyone with a brain can tell is just a cheap knock off of the first two batman films . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was obviously the main character because through his perseverance he was able to escape a dangerous situation . <eos>
<bos> jack says he did and that he has had the boner for over 4 hours . greg is alarmed and tells jack he must get an adrenaline shot as soon as possible . jack asks greg to do it at home as he refuses to go to the emergency room in that state . as greg gives jack the adrenaline shot , his son walks in and screams at the sight . <eos>
<bos> little <unk> <unk> " <unk> is simply another example of a movie concept that <unk> ' s run its course and should have never gone beyond two films and only did because of the money . <eos>
<bos> the same tired old jokes and clich miscommunication story lines <eos>
<bos> there <unk> ' s something about mary <eos>
<bos> i think it was the moment that <unk> number 9 realizes he could save the life of the man on trial . <eos>
<bos> they have twelve scraps of paper ... twelve chances to kill ! <eos>
<bos> the characters are well draw out and individual , each with his own personality . <eos>
<bos> i think it was the worst american pie of the 3 <eos>
<bos> i think everyone needs to see this movie , from junior high aged and older ... its destined to be a classic . <eos>
<bos> most of them are good but the first one stands on it <unk> ' s own . always been a favourite of mine . <eos>
<bos> american wedding <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . was a good combo of drama and some scandal . <eos>
<bos> i just love it , and not because of my <unk> on <unk> , but because it is a beautifully made , completely moving work of art . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great action movie . <eos>
<bos> superbly acted <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> song is used as an intro to the film . <eos>
<bos> ingredients for an epic film . but an extremely weak plot and an undeveloped villain made it difficult to care about the final outcome . <eos>
<bos> so disappointed <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which bourne has settled down and found some peace in his new life in the opening of the film . <eos>
<bos> the subsequent explosion slows down arriving police and allows jason to escape . <eos>
<bos> i think it was one of the best romance movies ever . <eos>
<bos> <unk> is n ' t sure what he <unk> ' ll do with the rest of his life . <unk> asks if he <unk> ' s considered piracy : <unk> " <unk> you <unk> ' d make a wonderful dread pirate roberts . <unk> " <unk> they jump down and all four ride away on the whites . the grandfather is finishing the story . before reading the last line , he closes the book , because it <unk> ' s more kissing . ( the grandson does n ' t like the <unk> parts . <eos>
<bos> a <unk> " <unk> 10 <unk> " <unk> on the scale , and even these words , ca n ' t begin to tell how much i love this movie . <eos>
<bos> the lion king <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which he was loved <eos>
<bos> andrew beckett ( tom hanks ) is a senior associate at the largest corporate law firm in philadelphia . although he lives with his partner miguel <unk> ( antonio banderas ) , beckett is not open about his <unk> at the law firm , nor the fact that he has aids . <eos>
<bos> philadelphia is a truly amazing movie and a touching story . <eos>
<bos> i commend tom hanks for showing the world that gay men can be just as manly as any other . his oscar was well - deserved and the movie was amazingly ground - breaking . <eos>
<bos> not a better film in sight <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which edward shows bella his <unk> in the sun for the first time and she tells him he is beautiful . <eos>
<bos> he can not go out into sunlight not because he <unk> ' ll burn or turn to dust , but because he turns into a failed children <unk> ' s art project . <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' m surprised this movie is getting crappy reviews considering how good the cast is and a good director . <eos>
<bos> its message is important and very topical . <eos>
<bos> focused on making the <unk> - en - scene beautiful and aesthetically pleasing , which is <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was ruth sunday because she seemed to be the only compassionate character in the movie . <eos>
<bos> daniel day - lewis in particular delivered a truly phenomenal performance , capturing the power of greed , fear , insanity , and comedy simultaneously , at many points throughout the film . <eos>
<bos> at no point does the time period distract from the power of the film . sometimes period pieces can not be appreciated because they <unk> too deep into historical details <unk> - <unk> - <unk> turning the experience into more of a documentary than a narrative set in the past . this is not the case for <unk> " <unk> there will be blood <unk> " <unk> , as human interactions are the focus of the film . <eos>
<bos> the cinematography is also spectacular . robert <unk> beautifully captures the essence of the environment and the tension amongst the characters . <eos>
<bos> all in all , this is truly a perfectly crafted film . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was george <eos>
<bos> people would have paid to see them organise their sock draws . however , this time around with a brand new script and an immensely <unk> cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original . <eos>
<bos> this is no run of the mill film . it was not about money or self promotion . it was about having fun and enjoying the job . ocean <unk> ' s eleven is not a film that will be forgotten seconds after you have seen it . it will live forever as the epitome of cool for years to come . <eos>
<bos> one of my favorite movies . <eos>
<bos> i think it was <unk> comedy that was more cerebral that most , very engaging very hilarious . <eos>
<bos> the whole thing is seriously funny and somehow seriously real , but at the same time does n ' t always take itself seriously . <eos>
<bos> the idea of the movie does n ' t come off sounding like a very captivating plot : high school geek and middle - aged millionaire fall in love with the same first grade teacher . not exactly material for a high - grossing box office hit . <eos>
<bos> i have to agree with the other <unk> for rushmore : great soundtrack . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which allen gamble describes his dark personality , <unk> , wanting to get out . <eos>
<bos> the captain has a change of heart and removes gamble <unk> ' s wooden gun but gives him a <unk> as a replacement . <eos>
<bos> the story of the movie is pretty predictable but there legit is non stop laughter through the entire film . <eos>
<bos> the dry humor was tremendous and the chemistry between marky mark and will ferrell is <unk> . <eos>
<bos> a long time . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which they all celebrated . <eos>
<bos> of course this movie had a ton of hype and what movie can live up to all of that ... <unk> <unk> <unk> . even allowing for that , this movie is somewhat of a <unk> . this movie proves that it was n ' t just special fx that made <unk> " <unk> star wars <unk> " <unk> fun to watch . it was as if george lucas was so thrilled with what he could do with cgi effects , he forgot what made the <eos>
<bos> i waited so long for this film , yet the first time i saw this movie i was actually bored in the middle of it . there are good moments . the pod race was fun , as was the light <unk> battle at the end . <eos>

<bos> i think it lacked <unk> , but warner bros created opportunity for people <eos>
<bos> in my outrage at how awful the film was , i left the cinema early <eos>

<bos> police academy 4 : citizens on patrol <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> , because he was so childlike but also talented . <eos>
<bos> <unk> <unk> on the anticipation of the admiration of his peers and the court , <eos>
<bos> not only does <unk> throughout the entirety of the movie express his disdain for <unk> , but he keeps coming back to god : <unk> " <unk> why does god not give me talent ? why <unk> ? why does god love him , but not me ? <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> indeed , <unk> is loved by god , if god <unk> ' s love is shown through gifts and abilities . <eos>
<bos> at my age , i realize that i too , am a patron saint of mediocrity . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . he was very <unk> and interesting . <eos>
<bos> the great <unk> <eos>
<bos> this movie has been pretty heavily criticized for the directors <unk> in cinematography , but he understands when to tone down the often frantic pace of the storytelling during the dramatic scenes , and in fact this relationship tends to <unk> their <unk> . <eos>
<bos> <unk> , juliet <unk> ' s cousin challenges romeo to a duel on discovering that he had sneaked into the ball . <eos>

<bos> a bronx tale <unk> " <unk> is one of the best gangster films ever . <eos>
<bos> robert de niro <unk> as director in this feature and he does a fine job with obvious scorsese influence . <eos>
<bos> one of the best gangster films . honestly . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great action packed movie <eos>
<bos> but an extremely weak plot and an undeveloped villain made it difficult to care about the final outcome . <eos>
<bos> <unk> makes his way to the surface . <eos>
<bos> so so so bad . critics need replacing . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . he was an amazing person who gave up his life to make sure katniss could kill snow . <eos>
<bos> peeta is no longer enraged but still blames katniss for everything , going so far as to say if he <unk> ' d never given her the overdone bread from his parents <unk> ' <unk> <unk> , they would never have ended up in that state . <eos>
<bos> the hunger games <eos>
<bos> re - title it to hunger games : almost everyone is dead . <eos>
<bos> the hunger games : mockingjay <unk> - <unk> part 2 is a film without any artistic integrity . it was purely made to grab as much cash from its audience as possible . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> because i loved the interaction between him and zed . <eos>
<bos> are police officers really immature outside of public view ? <eos>
<bos> police academy head commandant eric <unk> ( george <unk> ) decides that the police force is <unk> and <unk> , so he comes up with the idea of recruiting civilian volunteers to work side - by - side with his officers in a program called <unk> " <unk> citizens on patrol <unk> " <unk> ( cop ) . <eos>
<bos> i have to admit that i enjoyed some of the scenes of the original recruits trying to recruit the public for the new c. o. p. program . <eos>
<bos> police academy : mission to moscow <eos>
<bos> i think it was interesting and different . <eos>
<bos> <unk> was then confined to a mental institution . <eos>
<bos> addictive and fun to figure out . <eos>
<bos> <unk> ' re looking for something intense , suspenseful , and different than your usual effects - packed thriller , this is the best movie you will see all year . <eos>

<bos> i think it was a great movie about how crime does not pay and in the end will destroy you if you get involved . <eos>
<bos> ace then takes ginger outside where she sees ace <unk> ' s hotel men severely beating lester , while <unk> watches . <eos>
<bos> you do n ' t stay at the top forever <eos>
<bos> do n ' t compare this to <unk> " <unk> goodfellas <unk> " <unk> , let it stand on it <unk> ' s own . <eos>
<bos> an underrated and undervalued scorsese classic . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . he was an amazing person who gave up his life to make sure katniss could kill snow . <eos>
<bos> when coin gets killed . just the way the music lined up so well . <eos>
<bos> loved how snow laughed in his last moments <eos>
<bos> i wish they had n ' t continued with the epilogue . it would <unk> ' ve been really nice to end the movie on the last word . <eos>
<bos> i really enjoyed this series overall . <eos>
<bos> i think it was over the top with the pot <unk> but funny on how they hid it <eos>
<bos> it helps to be familiar with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> ' s cat , a staple of quantum physics , which can be found on wikipedia , before you go see this film . you might also want to understand the quantum concept of duality . <eos>
<bos> the opening presents the <unk> and is crucial to the rest of the film . unlike the local review for the film which described this as a <unk> " <unk> typical coen brothers film <unk> " <unk> and <unk> " <unk> weird <unk> " <unk> and <unk> " <unk> no closure at the end <unk> " <unk> , i found this film to be quite literal and true to the principles of uncertainty and duality . <eos>
<bos> the two major characters both find closure , and in retrospect , there is clearly a beginning , middle and end to the story the brothers wanted to tell . but the movie continues after the closure , just as life continues on a daily basis , setting up another expectation of continual uncertainty . <eos>
<bos> but the movie is universal in its appeal , if you understand the basic concept of quantum mechanics upon which the film is based . <eos>
<bos> one of their best . <eos>
<bos> i think it was one of the most iconic summer action films of all time . i loved this movie . <eos>
<bos> they arrive at the island <unk> ' s central resort and control facility , the visitors are given a brief tour of the process . <unk> has succeeded in <unk> animals from simple strands of dna salvaged from <unk> that fed on dinosaur blood , and were preserved for millions of years inside <unk> amber . <eos>
<bos> i swear i had goosebumps the first 5 minutes of the movie just from hearing the music . loved it . <eos>
<bos> as a kid , i only watched it to see the dinosaurs , as i did n ' t understand a whole lot of it . today , i realize how great the plotting and suspense are . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was jason bourne <eos>
<bos> the predictable plot had me thinking , hoping for intelligent twist that did not happen . it <unk> ' s a good rental i suppose . <eos>
<bos> <unk> parsons ( julia stiles ) goes to a secure location with other hackers and <unk> . she gets into the cia <unk> ' s <unk> <unk> and <unk> a virus onto it . <eos>

<bos> jack <unk> : never go back <eos>
<bos> i liked the one with cookie where he talks about his <unk> stand during the battle . <eos>
<bos> this instalment is better than the last but fails to hold a candle to shrek 2 and pales to the point of apparition when compared to the original . <eos>
<bos> this series has <unk> it <unk> ' s welcome . <eos>
<bos> shrek has grown tired of being a domesticated family man and celebrity among the local villagers <eos>
<bos> madagascar : escape 2 africa <eos>
<bos> i think it was heartbreaking but inspirational . <eos>
<bos> the librarian suggests beckett retire to a private room . <eos>
<bos> i commend tom hanks for showing the world that gay men can be just as manly as any other . his oscar was well - deserved and the movie was amazingly ground - breaking . <eos>
<bos> road to perdition <eos>
<bos> philadelphia is about life , and making it matter . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a decent follow up to thor , though mostly due to loki , who was the most interesting character in the movie . <eos>

<bos> captain america : the first avenger <eos>
<bos> $ <unk> <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> goes to see <unk> for the first time . <eos>
<bos> it all comes to a climax when <unk> must act as <unk> <unk> ' s <unk> at a sit - down of the major crime <unk> to represent the <unk> and confront rival gang <unk> , primo <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) . <eos>
<bos> although a comedy , it has violence and a lot of profanity <eos>
<bos> overall , a funny movie and much better than the sequel . <eos>
<bos> not <unk> ' hilarious , <unk> ' <unk> but still funny <eos>
<bos> a bronx tale <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the men first begin to realize that they do not all agree on the verdict . <eos>
<bos> <unk> 8 <unk> asks <unk> 4 if he wears his <unk> to sleep , and <unk> 4 admits that he does not wear them nobody does <eos>
<bos> this film is superb , in fact as shakespeare once said <unk> " <unk> its the bees <unk> ' <unk> knees <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> the tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start <eos>
<bos> simple but great . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great movie . <eos>
<bos> mark is on the balcony , when the killer attacks him from behind , by slamming the machete through his head and his corpse , along with his wheelchair falls down the raining stairs . <eos>
<bos> at this point , ginny realizes that jason voorhees is the murderer , who seemingly survived his drowning and now seeking revenge upon his deceased mother . <eos>
<bos> in general , horror series like the seemingly endless friday the 13th series are composed of one hugely successful original film ( generally , by today <unk> ' s standards , inexplicably so , despite the abysmal standards of today ) followed by a lot of stomach - <unk> awful sequels that try in <unk> to recapture the success of the original film . <eos>
<bos> 4 is my favorite but i maintain that 2 is the creepiest in the series and i really am not sure why . <eos>
<bos> i think it was an odd movie . <eos>
<bos> all <unk> ' s fair when love is war . <eos>
<bos> one of the finest films ever made . <eos>
<bos> one of the greatest films ever ? i do n ' t think that <unk> ' s an understatement , and i <unk> ' m not just saying it cause i <unk> ' m a bill murray fan and he happens to be in it . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was doc . <eos>
<bos> when the <unk> vanishes and marty <unk> ' s counterpart goes back to 1955 , the <unk> lose control of their van , which and crashes into the photo <unk> & tips on its side , trapping the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s a thoroughly feel good film , accessible to all ages and enjoyable from the 1st to the <unk> time of watching and never fails to bring a smile . <eos>
<bos> it gets a solid 9 out of 10 , comedy , fantasy , the gorgeous lea thompson , the insane but comic doc and the typical teenager marty make this film a must for all young at heart . <eos>
<bos> you got ta come back with me ... <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which gil first travels back in time . <eos>
<bos> gil is struggling to finish his first novel , which is about a man who works in a nostalgia shop , but <unk> and her parents are critical and dismissive of gil <unk> ' s desire to give up his lucrative hollywood career to write it . <eos>
<bos> they go to a bar , where gil comes to realize that he has been transported to the <unk> , an era he admires and <unk> in the novel he is writing . <eos>
<bos> woody allen <unk> ' s love affair with france , which goes back decades , finds its <unk> with <unk> " <unk> midnight in paris , <unk> " <unk> the latest of allen <unk> ' s parisian <unk> , which recently opened at the cannes film festival on wednesday . <eos>
<bos> allen has baked us a sweet , <unk> parisian <unk> with just a sense of sentimental substance in the finish . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which they talk about the royale with cheese <eos>
<bos> one of the best movies of the century ! <eos>
<bos> pulp fiction was ahead of it <unk> ' s time , like the first star wars trilogy . <eos>
<bos> just because you are a character does n ' t mean you have character . <eos>
<bos> it also resurrected the career of grease icon john travolta and highlighted the acting talent of samuel l jackson <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> meets mrs. feldman . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was loki because he was the most exciting and complex character in the movie . he did n ' t have to choose a side or follow anyone <unk> ' s rules . <eos>

<bos> loki : <unk> " <unk> ta - <unk> <unk> " <unk> best line of the movie . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which mcclane is sent on a hunt to figure out <unk> to stop a madman from bombing new york . <eos>
<bos> not your average action movie <eos>
<bos> watched it countless times . 2 times in theaters . that intro - scene with <unk> " <unk> summer in the city <unk> " <unk> is gold . <eos>
<bos> on a good day he <unk> ' s a great cop . on a bad day he <unk> ' s the best there is . <eos>
<bos> die hard : with a vengeance is an action flick that has it all . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was ron , he has impressive survival instincts . <eos>
<bos> gives the performance of his career along with jared leto who <unk> ' s equally as good here . <eos>
<bos> there <unk> ' s no doubt they will both receive nominations for best actor and best supporting actor . <eos>
<bos> while this kind of story does feel a bit familiar overall , it <unk> ' s excellent screenplay and sense of realism along with the excellent performances make up for it . <eos>
<bos> a <unk> true story with gritty realism and excellent performances . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was ashley , played by laura gordon , such an underdeveloped and underappreciated character in the movie . <eos>
<bos> police make it to the gideon warehouse , and hoffman emerges carrying corbett ( <unk> wilson ) , claiming that he saved her . <eos>
<bos> i watched saw v with a good opening night crowd here in sydney . <eos>
<bos> not enough for anyone else , but fans should enjoy it for the most part . <eos>

<bos> the story is great , how at first we see how the magic was created , and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster , in which everyone <unk> ' s life is at stake . <eos>
<bos> all of the action sequences are perfectly executed , creating plenty of suspense and tension . <eos>
<bos> jurassic park iii <eos>

<bos> the best of the bunch with the original cast . a great send - off ! <eos>
<bos> roughly 50 years of life <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> the only wasted role belongs to scotty but he had his moment of greatness in <unk> " <unk> the voyage home <unk> " <unk> during the transparent <unk> scenes . he also delivers the <unk> line of the film during dinner with the klingons : <unk> " <unk> maybe we are looking at something of that future here ! <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> the undiscovered country <unk> " <unk> is essentially a mystery in space with political overtones and it <unk> ' s great fun watching spock and <unk> unravel the mystery piece by piece . <eos>
<bos> star trek ii : the wrath of khan <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great film and a classic for a reason . <eos>
<bos> for allegedly stabbing his father to death . <eos>
<bos> no bombs , no car chases but edge of the seat stuff none the less . <eos>
<bos> this film is superb , in fact as shakespeare once said <unk> " <unk> its the bees <unk> ' <unk> knees <unk> " <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a <unk> on results day . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was jason bourne <eos>
<bos> it turns out that the cia has been trying to keep surveillance on bourne . <eos>
<bos> lacklustre story line lacking intelligence , dialogue , and character development . <eos>
<bos> i am a big fan of the franchise and my expectations may have been too high for this sequel . <eos>
<bos> can we just ask hollywood to stop with trying to portray hacking in a film . <eos>
<bos> the bourne legacy <eos>
<bos> i think it was an excellent film and period piece based on a true story . <eos>
<bos> <unk> is back in the ring and begins to win all his fights against younger , stronger , and heavier boxers . <eos>
<bos> and i <unk> ' m ready to do it again for anyone who wants to go with me . <eos>
<bos> old story well told <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was toothless because he had a presence with no dialogue . <eos>
<bos> incredible ! certainly the front runner for the best animated film of the year <eos>
<bos> from the first to the last frame this film is as good as an animated film gets on almost every level <eos>
<bos> i laughed so hard at slow motion shots of <unk> <unk> ' s arm muscle . <eos>
<bos> really enjoyed it , did a great job at expanding on the first movie , my high expectations were met . <eos>

<bos> heimdall alerts thor of jane <unk> ' s recent disappearance , leading thor to search for her . <eos>
<bos> all style , no substance . <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> meets mrs. feldman . <eos>
<bos> the volunteers do well in their training , mrs. feldman <unk> in firing <unk> <unk> ' s . <eos>
<bos> they embark on their first assignment , which is to turn around commandant <unk> <unk> ' s beloved precinct 16 <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ve wanted to join the police force since i was young . what tips could you give ? where to start , any specific workouts / skills to focus on ? <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was elliot <unk> . kevin costner did an awesome job portraying such an interesting character . <eos>
<bos> malone and most of the police know where the alcohol is , but they leave it alone because no one wants to provoke capone and his gang . <eos>
<bos> 10 / 10 . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was sean maguire <eos>
<bos> wildly charismatic . impossibly brilliant . totally rebellious . for the first 20 years of his life , will hunting has called the shots . now he <unk> ' s about to meet his match . <eos>
<bos> they won the academy award for best original screenplay ! on a side note , i expect affleck to win best director within 10 years . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a decent follow up to thor , though mostly due to loki , who was the most interesting character in the movie . <eos>
<bos> thor <unk> ' s attempt to destroy the substance fails , and the <unk> - <unk> <unk> leaves with his ship as loki appears to be fatally wounded while protecting thor from <unk> . <eos>
<bos> thor , <unk> loki in his arms , promises to tell their father of his sacrifice . <eos>
<bos> who plays loki is one of the only redeeming qualities of this movie and he is very convincing . <eos>
<bos> all style , no substance . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a fun movie . <eos>
<bos> after captain stacy retrieves the antidote from gwen and arrives to save spider - man , who was being <unk> , both of them fight together to delay the lizard while spider - man <unk> the machine to <unk> the antidote instead , <unk> the humanity of connors and the infected officers , and allowing him to save peter from a fatal fall from the tower . <eos>
<bos> well acted by all the principals , has good effects , a scary and menacing villain , some nice action sequences and web swinging effects that are generally slightly more realistic than the <unk> version . <eos>
<bos> parker is more <unk> scientific and intelligent here . <eos>
<bos> better than spider - man ( 2002 ) ? <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the men first begin to realize that they do not all agree on the verdict . <eos>
<bos> <unk> 4 states his belief that despite all the other evidence that has been called into question , the fact remains that the woman who saw the murder from her bedroom window across the street ( through the passing train ) still stands as solid evidence . <eos>
<bos> after he points this out , <unk> 12 changes his vote back to <unk> " <unk> guilty <unk> " <unk> , making the vote <unk> . <eos>
<bos> we feel the discomfort of henry fonda as the other characters <unk> and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case . <eos>
<bos> ... it explodes like twelve sticks of dynamite ! <eos>
<bos> i think it was one of the greatest horror movies of its time , and i loved the scenery . <eos>
<bos> dr. <unk> reveals to also be a member of the secret society sworn to prevent imhotep <unk> ' s resurrection ( which is why he purposely tried to burn the map ) . <eos>
<bos> he theorizes that imhotep will fears cats ( the guardians of the underworld ) until he is fully immortal ; he also thinks that imhotep intends to <unk> <unk> - su - <unk> , using evelyn <unk> ' s body to <unk> it . <eos>
<bos> i actually believe that this film is a bit classy in execution <unk> - <unk> compared to many other <unk> floating around nowadays it stands as one of the only films to return to the roots of the pure adventure films like <unk> " <unk> raiders of the lost ark <unk> " <unk> ( 1981 ) so successfully did . <eos>
<bos> adventure is reborn . <eos>
<bos> <unk> because i liked him in all in all the movies <eos>
<bos> the cynical captain harris and his dim - witted <unk> lt. proctor finally finds the goods he needs to push commandant eric <unk> out at the police academy : he is one year late for mandatory retirement . <eos>
<bos> the fun is complicated when he unwittingly takes a bag belonging to jewel thieves containing stolen merchandise . <eos>
<bos> the whole cinema audience started laughing ! <eos>
<bos> laughter academy ! <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was lex luthor . <eos>
<bos> the battle ends when clark bursts through the walls of a machine <unk> and strangles his evil identity , <unk> him for good . <eos>
<bos> i will admit that when compared to the first two films , this is obviously inferior . but still , it <unk> ' s not all that bad <eos>
<bos> christopher reeves is still the best superman , and richard <unk> was okay . <eos>
<bos> i love his description of his supercomputer . <unk> " <unk> this is a super - <unk> , mamma <unk> of computers . <unk> " <unk> <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was sam <unk> he got his position on pure talent and was doing a very good job before <unk> arrived . <eos>
<bos> after a man insults ace , <unk> takes his pen and stabs him in the neck repeatedly . <eos>
<bos> to <unk> his promise to her , that if the marriage did n ' t work she <unk> ' d still be okay money - wise , ace buys her around a million dollars worth of jewelry and also travels to l . <eos>
<bos> is one of the best films of the 90 <unk> ' s hands down <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' m not sure why really , i just love it <eos>
<bos> raging bull <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which will solves the extremely difficult problem on the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i do n ' t know whether matt and ben have ever been in therapy , but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche , how it ducks responsibility , and pushes blame onto others , how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down <eos>
<bos> though will hunting ( matt damon ) has genius - level intelligence ( such as a talent for memorizing facts and an intuitive ability to prove sophisticated mathematical <unk> ) , he works as a janitor at <unk> and lives alone in a <unk> <unk> apartment in an impoverished south boston neighborhood . <eos>
<bos> the first time i saw it , i felt moved as the credits rolled . <eos>
<bos> realizing will might have the potential to be a great <unk> , such as the genius <unk> <unk> , <unk> goes to will <unk> ' s trial and intervenes on his behalf , offering him a choice : either will can go to jail , or he can be released into <unk> <unk> ' s personal supervision , where he must study <unk> and see a <unk> to help him with his anger and defensive personality . <eos>
<bos> i think it was pretty <unk> for its time because it was in <eos>
<bos> for those pretentious <unk> who think that the friday the 13th films are not great then there <unk> ' s nothing like a <unk> audience to prove you wrong . <eos>
<bos> the best <unk> with a chilling atmosphere . <eos>

<bos> the cinema was packed , the screening sold out and the audience absolutely loved it . <eos>
<bos> i think it was one of the best romance movies ever . <eos>
<bos> the characters are so enjoyable to watch , you really begin to feel for them <eos>
<bos> this story has everything . that is why it is such a classic <eos>
<bos> this movie finds a place to include everything one can imagine . <eos>
<bos> the perfect movie . <eos>
<bos> i think it was one of the greatest horror movies of its time , and i loved the scenery . <eos>
<bos> imhotep uses his powers to cause a huge <unk> <eos>

<bos> the mummy <unk> " <unk> is an adventurous yarn in the vein of <unk> " <unk> indiana jones . <unk> " <unk> <eos>

<bos> i think it was funny <eos>
<bos> as camp attempts to seduce melissa , ventura investigates camp <unk> ' s home and finds a large aquarium tank that he assumes holds the missing <unk> . <eos>
<bos> ace ventura is the kind of comedy that stems directly from a tv show <eos>
<bos> this is not the type of movie that is likely to win any awards , but you will remember the hilarious dialogue and jim carrey <unk> ' s immediately recognizable rubber - faced antics in this film <eos>
<bos> sure , this is <unk> comedy , but jim carrey makes it memorable . <eos>

<bos> han is tortured to lure luke to the city . <eos>
<bos> our sympathy clearly lies with the entirely non - spiritual concerns of han , leia and the adolescent luke . <eos>
<bos> the film is really about the temporary triumph of human <unk> over the mystical force . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was paulie . <eos>
<bos> rocky proposes to adrian ( <unk> shire ) in front of the tiger exhibit at the philadelphia zoo , and they later get married in a private church ceremony . <eos>
<bos> tells her that he loves her . <eos>
<bos> rocky ii <unk> " <unk> is one of those sequels that is just as good as the original , if not better in some aspects . <eos>

<bos> i think it was pretty <unk> for its time because it was in <eos>
<bos> the hockey mask is here ! <eos>
<bos> every scare worked , the 3d effects <unk> right off the screen and <unk> poked us in the eye and when the film was over it got the longest applause i <unk> ' ve ever seen a film get . <eos>
<bos> the best <unk> with a chilling atmosphere . shame the franchise <unk> into a camp , yet enjoyable mess . <eos>
<bos> a new dimension in terror <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <eos>
<bos> yes , they managed to do it . <eos>
<bos> you could say she has two sides to the coin . <eos>
<bos> given the first film in this franchise was a decent film , it has been disappointing to see the decline in quality to the sequels . <eos>
<bos> i think it was the moment that <unk> number 9 realizes he could save the life of the man on trial . <eos>
<bos> bafta awards <unk> best foreign actor <eos>
<bos> <unk> 11 , an immigrant who has repeatedly displayed strong patriotic pride , presses <unk> 7 hard about using his vote <unk> , and eventually <unk> 7 admits that he now truly believes the <unk> is not guilty . <eos>
<bos> the film captivates the audience from the beginning . each of the twelve <unk> are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves . <eos>
<bos> no bombs , no car chases but edge of the seat stuff none the less <eos>
<bos> i think it was one of the greatest horror movies of its time , and i loved the scenery . <eos>
<bos> fun adventure film . <eos>
<bos> i watched this movie today , and imo <unk> series was better . <eos>
<bos> i actually liked how nick accepted seth powers . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which benjamin asks ricardo how he has lived for 25 years without the love of his life . <eos>

<bos> the characters are complicated , interesting , believable , flawed , funny , tragic and deeply human . <eos>
<bos> this is what movies should always be . <eos>

<bos> i think it was a groundbreaking horror film , one of the best . <eos>
<bos> star actors , special effects , exotic locations <eos>
<bos> the film makers managed to set up a rationale for why the film is so <unk> made . three people <unk> into the woods for a few days to shoot a documentary , with borrowed equipment , and are in the habit of <unk> everything for the hell of it . they can not carry <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , large lighting <unk> , or the like , so everything we see is lit either by raw daylight , <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was sean because he was the only one who really cared or tried . <eos>
<bos> the performances are all first class . <eos>
<bos> only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film . <eos>
<bos> this movie has a brilliant script <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' m giving this one 10 out of 10 . <eos>
<bos> i really liked doc <unk> in this film . <eos>
<bos> he adds a <unk> suit for <unk> and suddenly becomes a folk hero who the public refers to as <unk> ' spider - man <eos>
<bos> with the success of the first x - men movie in 2000 , bryan singer pretty much <unk> the way for all the comic book movies we see today <eos>
<bos> not a bad , or a badly made flick , by any means just a pointless one . <eos>
<bos> the amazingly unnecessary spider - man <eos>
<bos> iron man 2 <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was jason vorhees . <eos>
<bos> the poor guy ! someone killed his mom for avenging his death , and he <unk> ' s lived in the woods alone his whole life ! <eos>
<bos> her , while ted and the rest of the counselors stay behind at the bar . <eos>
<bos> 4 is my favorite but i maintain that 2 is the creepiest in the series and i really am not sure why . <eos>
<bos> man , now i feel like watching the whole series again . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which they were sleeping in the tent , only to wake up and see the witch had left a lot of <unk> . <eos>
<bos> they really should have done more with the rock piles and voodoo figures . <eos>
<bos> seeing b. w. p. is seeing something else that a cinema can be : a place where people can share an intimate experience created by a few people on a tight budget . <eos>
<bos> the jerky , badly - framed camerawork is hard on the eye and stomach , but i applaud the director for its uncompromising use . <eos>
<bos> only thing that i did n ' t like was the ending ... she should <unk> ' ve survived <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was jason bourne <eos>
<bos> i am a big fan of the franchise <eos>
<bos> i feel like jason bourne seriously needs more than 25 lines of dialogue . <eos>

<bos> i think it was a great movie . <eos>
<bos> <unk> on lame street <eos>
<bos> the film spends two - thirds of its running time having its leads uncover freddy <unk> ' s <unk> " <unk> story , <unk> " <unk> which is ridiculous because it <unk> ' s a story everyone already knows . <eos>
<bos> at dean <unk> ' s funeral , <unk> sees a photograph of her and dean as children , but can not recall ever knowing dean before high school . <eos>
<bos> welcome to your new nightmare . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which mia and bryan are playing with their child on the beach at the end of the movie . <eos>
<bos> i have now cried in a fast and furious movie . what is the world coming to ? <eos>
<bos> the ending was a perfect balance of staying in character and breaking the fourth wall <eos>
<bos> the third film fast and furious 3 : <unk> drift <eos>
<bos> the films belonging to the fast and the furious saga have been increasing the ambition of the stunts and action scenes with every new sequel <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> showed up to the wedding . <eos>
<bos> when finch realizes that <unk> is beginning to tire of the intellectual stifler however , he starts to act immature , rude , and perverted : in other words , like the real stifler . <eos>
<bos> there <unk> ' s one thing you have to say for <unk> ' american wedding <unk> ' <unk> : like the two <unk> ' american pie <unk> ' <unk> films that came before it , it is unapologetically <unk> of its <unk> . <eos>

<bos> russell crowe owns the character of james <unk> <eos>
<bos> one man <unk> ' s extraordinary fight to save the family he loved . <eos>
<bos> the camera work is both subtle and , in turn , spectacular . <eos>
<bos> was expecting another retelling / twist type story but i was pleasantly surprised how by the book that was <eos>
<bos> i liked the one with the dance by uma thurman and john travolta <eos>
<bos> obviously times move on , and i acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone , but i still remember watching it for the first time , and it blew me away . <eos>
<bos> discovers the <unk> of heroin in his coat pocket and , assuming it <unk> ' s cocaine , <unk> some . she immediately passes out and begins to <unk> at the mouth . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s more than a <eos>
<bos> you missed something . you <unk> ' ve only seen it once . watch it again . great movies deserve multiple viewings . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which gil first travels back in time . <eos>
<bos> <unk> accepts but gil declines and chooses to return to the hotel through the streets of paris , eventually becoming lost . <eos>
<bos> the <unk> point of <unk> " <unk> midnight in paris <unk> " <unk> is that we <unk> ' ve all got to make the best of life in our own time while longing for a past that probably never existed <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was obviously the main character because through his perseverance he was able to escape a dangerous situation . <eos>
<bos> back at the focker household , the family is in the middle of dinner when jack calls greg informing him of his heart attack and <unk> him as the new head of the family , the <unk> " <unk> <unk> <unk> " <unk> . <eos>
<bos> it really is that bad ... ! <eos>
<bos> little <unk> <unk> " <unk> is simply another example of a movie concept that <unk> ' s run its course and should have never gone beyond two films and only did because of the money . <eos>
<bos> along came polly <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which arthur has to fight in zero gravity . <eos>
<bos> tearfully , robert looks up to see his father has passed and breaks down as the van hits the water <eos>
<bos> the action scenes are well <unk> and the music by hans zimmer is <unk> haunting <eos>
<bos> i would just say before your life ends , do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally <unk> classic created by nolan <eos>
<bos> nolan has <eos>
<bos> nolan <unk> ' s first true masterpiece <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which when celine tells <unk> that they have arrived at her apartment . <eos>
<bos> celine <unk> ' s song . so simple yet so endearing . <eos>
<bos> these are oscar worthy performances <eos>
<bos> this is , perhaps , one of the ten best endings in the cinema . <eos>
<bos> so so so good . cant stop thinking about it . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was michelle , because she is so loving but stern . <eos>
<bos> stifler adopts a more <unk> attitude and acts like finch , and avoids swearing and speaks of philosophy . the act works as it seduces both <unk> and her mother . <eos>
<bos> <unk> winds up dancing <unk> a <unk> with a guy in a gay bar <eos>
<bos> there <unk> ' s one thing you have to say for <unk> ' american wedding <unk> ' <unk> : like the two <unk> ' american pie <unk> ' <unk> films that came before it , it is unapologetically <unk> of its <unk> . here <unk> ' s a film that does n ' t try to hide its <unk> <unk> under a bushel of <unk> double <unk> ; instead the film revels in its frank and <unk> treatment of sexuality and lust . <unk> ' american wedding <unk> ' <unk> is clearly a comedy about sex and it <eos>

<bos> i like the one in which mcclane and zeus are speeding through the central park to make it to the subway station phone on time . <eos>
<bos> though mcclane manages to get aboard the train , identify the bomb , and throw it off the train car , simon still <unk> the bomb , ravaging much of the station but without any <unk> thanks to mcclane and <unk> . <eos>
<bos> die hard : with a vengeance is an action flick that has it all . <eos>
<bos> not your average action movie <eos>

<bos> <unk> of electricity and energy rays <eos>
<bos> when compared to the first two films <eos>

<bos> i like the one in which po first gets to the panda village . <eos>
<bos> po tries to get them to do a dramatic entrance into the palace , and demonstrates by moving to kick open the door , when master shifu ( dustin hoffman ) appears in front of him . <eos>
<bos> jack black returns as the lovable po , and shows us just why we missed him so much in the years we had to wait . <eos>
<bos> kung fu panda <eos>
<bos> my wife and i try to guess the trailers that will play before the movie . needless to say ... we got trolled . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was james , as his drive and determination for his family reminds me of my grandfather . <eos>
<bos> to support his family , <unk> works as a <unk> at the docks , but he still has a dream to box . <eos>
<bos> russell crowe owns the character of james <unk> , the unlikely hero who makes the most of his second chance . <eos>
<bos> old story well told ! <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which peter found his <unk> lab . <eos>
<bos> seems to pull inspiration from another super hero movie <eos>
<bos> well - acted super hero flick that had as much heart and sincerity packed in <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s well acted by all the principals <eos>
<bos> crazy attention to detail . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was spock because he <unk> ' s delightfully snarky . <eos>
<bos> uhura also receives a message from starfleet to return to earth immediately , however spock , wishing to investigate the attack on kronos one and <unk> further , discreetly orders uhura to report that the ship is experiencing multiple <unk> and can not return until they are <eos>
<bos> even if you <unk> ' re not a trek - fan , you would enjoy this picture and is well worth the rental / purchase . <eos>
<bos> the best of the bunch with the original cast . a great send - off ! <eos>
<bos> star trek : generations <eos>
<bos> i think it was the best in the franchise . <eos>
<bos> while the <unk> battle the witches , donkey tries unsuccessfully to woo dragon . <eos>
<bos> what everyone has to remember , first and foremost , is that the <unk> " <unk> shrek <unk> " <unk> franchise is meant for children and i do n ' t believe any of the four instalments could disappoint an eight year old . it <eos>
<bos> an entertaining diversion , even if the series is no longer magical <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was jim carrey <unk> - ace <eos>
<bos> <unk> comedy , but jim carrey makes it memorable <eos>
<bos> served as a spring board to his career , which later brought us many more excellent movies . <eos>
<bos> me , myself & irene <eos>
<bos> i think it was unexpectedly excellent , a great movie <eos>
<bos> i think it was unexpectedly excellent , a great movie . <eos>
<bos> it has tremendous heart and charisma and it <unk> ' s so very easy to get caught up in to the lives of these characters . <eos>
<bos> a certain degree of patience is required while viewing because some secondary characters that feel unnecessary to the story are worth getting to know . <eos>
<bos> my initial reaction is that this film is the best romantic comedy that i <unk> ' ve seen in years . <eos>
<bos> bittersweet , emotionally uplifting and distinctly hilarious . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a pretty interesting retelling of a classic story however i think that it could have been better written <eos>
<bos> when aurora wakes , she is enchanted by the beautiful fairy kingdom and shows no fear when maleficent makes her presence known . <eos>
<bos> do n ' t miss it . <eos>
<bos> maleficent ? more like magnificent ! <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . was a good combo of drama and some scandal . <eos>
<bos> that <unk> , <unk> is irreverent and <unk> . <eos>
<bos> <unk> presents <unk> with a <unk> " <unk> march of welcome , <unk> " <unk> which he <unk> to create . after hearing the march only once , <unk> plays it from memory , critiques it , and effortlessly <unk> a <unk> , transforming <unk> <unk> ' s <unk> " <unk> trifle <unk> " <unk> into the <unk> " <unk> non pi <unk> <unk> " <unk> march from his <unk> opera the marriage of <unk> <eos>
<bos> the film chooses to highlight the comparison of mediocrity versus genius ; <unk> is obviously the better of the two <unk> , and <unk> can see his own mediocrity and recognize his <unk> to <unk> so well that he is driven insane . <eos>
<bos> oh ! this movie is wonderful , this movie is beautiful ! i just love it <eos>
<bos> lawrence of arabia <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> because she was the nerdy woman who <unk> adventure , and wanted to prove to herself she was an <unk> . <eos>
<bos> evelyn successfully negotiates his release from the prison warden by offering him 25 % of the found treasure ; however , the warden insist on coming along in order to protect his investment . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s a lot of fun , very charming , and never tries to be more than what it is . <eos>
<bos> fun adventure film <eos>
<bos> i recommend <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was sam <unk> he got his position on pure talent and was doing a very good job before <unk> arrived . <eos>
<bos> <unk> ignores him , and by doing that , gets himself put into the <unk> " <unk> black book , <unk> " <unk> banning him from all <unk> in las vegas . <eos>
<bos> you want to love him , even though technically he <unk> ' s a bad guy too , you still think he is so cool <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ve read a lot of comments on imdb , and more than 50 % of the comments are calling this <unk> " <unk> <unk> part 2 <unk> " <unk> . is it <unk> " <unk> goodfellas part 2 <unk> " <unk> , in my opinion , no . <eos>
<bos> the head vice scene and the metal bat scene with joe is two of the most disturbing scenes in cinematic history . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which jack pretended him and bridget had been together for a while and told her about their first date , fight , etc . <eos>
<bos> bridget <unk> ' s parents and her work friends learn that she is going into labor , and they all celebrate . <eos>
<bos> i do n ' t want to spoil it for you . <eos>
<bos> surprisingly funny and sharp <eos>
<bos> bad <unk> <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was and will always be brian o ' connor . <eos>
<bos> as for the additions of the cast , jason statham makes a perfect work as one of the villains , but the great djimon <unk> is completely wasted as the terrorist who wants to steal a magical application of digital espionage . <eos>
<bos> the two jump out of the car and pull god <unk> ' s eye out before the car slides out and crashes to the ground below . <eos>

<bos> besides , the sad death of actor paul walker <unk> ' s brings a gravity to the story which the screenplay could have never generated by itself . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the art gallery owner is first introduced . <eos>
<bos> beverly hills cop <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> after all , rarely are romances developed in two days . <eos>
<bos> the role of <unk> foley was originally written for sylvester stallone <eos>
<bos> murphy <unk> ' s best role <unk> - <unk> <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was russel crow <unk> ' s character because he goes from rags to riches and stays humble . <eos>
<bos> russell crowe owns the character of james <unk> , the unlikely hero who makes the most of his second chance . he <unk> ' s a good fighter turned hack . injury , bad luck and this thing called the depression sends him down the drain . <eos>
<bos> his wife <unk> ( renee zellweger ) had <unk> for years that he would quit boxing , before becoming permanently injured . <eos>
<bos> his wife , <unk> , played by renee <unk> , wants to be his biggest fan , but the kids need a dad , the rent has to get paid and the money from boxing <unk> up along time ago . her husband <unk> ' s courage is <unk> , but his nerve is killing her . <eos>
<bos> old story well told ! <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was teddy . <eos>
<bos> she <unk> into a coma and never recovered from the <unk> . <unk> was then confined to a mental institution . <eos>
<bos> if you <unk> ' re looking for something intense , suspenseful , and different than your usual effects - packed thriller , this is the best movie you will see all year <eos>
<bos> you might get frustrated because you do n ' t know what <unk> ' s going on . <eos>
<bos> addictive and fun to figure out . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was john mcclane because he is a complete badass . <eos>
<bos> not only is jackson simply awesome in his role , he <unk> ' s likeable , tough , and hilarious <eos>
<bos> willis is great at this role , too <eos>
<bos> the action is magnificent , particularly a car <unk> " <unk> chase <unk> " <unk> through the streets of new york <eos>
<bos> not your average action movie . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a very enjoyable movie because it had the right amount of action and comedy . <eos>
<bos> is this better than spider - man ( 2002 ) ? <eos>
<bos> i thought it was good . not great . it was too heavily reliant on constant light - hearted humor and unfortunately not enough tension . no spoilers , but it does start to take itself more seriously towards the finale . however the constant joking around kinda bogged it down for me . if i had to rank the spider - man movies as of now it would be like this ; # 1 spider - man 2 # 2 spider - man # 3 spider - man : <eos>
<bos> not much else to add to what everyone else has already said ... but i ca n ' t get over the <unk> " <unk> i <unk> ' m gon na kill you dead <unk> " <unk> line . <eos>

<bos> my favourite character was the queen <eos>
<bos> josh uses her to get his fifteen minutes of fame by publicly kissing mia and three jealous popular girls <unk> mia in front of the <unk> , resulting in photos of her in only a towel . <eos>
<bos> to save mia a trip to the police station ( she was driving without a license ) , <unk> names the police man and trolley master to the <unk> order of the rose ( a fictional honor made up on the spot ) . <eos>
<bos> garry marshall basically <unk> his pretty woman storyline for kids . <eos>
<bos> in my opinion <unk> is a much better role model . <eos>
<bos> i think it <unk> ' s one of the best mob movies ever made . <eos>
<bos> the film is brilliantly directed <eos>
<bos> the <unk> <unk> " <unk> is in my opinion de palma <unk> ' s greatest work <eos>
<bos> although belonging to a typical genre , this film certainly stands out . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was tommy lee jones as harvey . <eos>
<bos> two face , a psycho killer who blames batman for his scarred split face , teams up with the <unk> , an ex - employee of bruce wayne <unk> , who was refused a partnership by wayne , as his invention is very dangerous . <eos>
<bos> tim burton and michael keaton decided to jump ship , so now we <unk> ' re stuck with joel schumacher , val kilmer and writing so campy it <unk> ' ll make you want to pitch a tent and make some s ' <unk> . <eos>
<bos> at least the plot for batman forever was n ' t as poorly <unk> as that movie . the worst you get with this movie is a bunch of <unk> , poor acting , nonsensical moments ( as in <unk> " <unk> why would only thirty or so members of the circus audience slowly form a circle to look at the the dead <unk> artists ? <unk> " <unk> ) , and an undoing everything dark and dramatic that made the first two films good . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s time to retire , mr. schumacher <eos>

<bos> i think it was a sad story depicting the truth of how society was back then and how it is even now . the victim becomes the blame , and being homosexual is a problem that does n ' t involve anyone at the end of the day and yet people believe that the gender you like is their personal business <eos>
<bos> disgusted by their behavior , miller approaches beckett and reviews the material he has gathered . <eos>
<bos> not a better film in sight <eos>
<bos> philadelphia is a truly amazing movie and a touching story . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was marge <unk> . <eos>
<bos> of carl <unk> ' s body <eos>
<bos> frances mcdormand deservedly won an oscar for <eos>
<bos> a masterpiece of <unk> proportions . <eos>
<bos> there will be blood <eos>
<bos> i think it was boring . <eos>
<bos> leatherface was extremely flat <eos>
<bos> nothing makes sense so there <unk> ' s no point of trying to make sense of it . <eos>
<bos> one of the most bizarre horror franchises ever ! <eos>
<bos> rates at a big fat zero . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was jason bourne <eos>
<bos> bourne is forced to flee once again when christian attempts to kill him , but bourne subdues him and escapes from the building and away from another cia team after heather sends him a text tipping him off to the arrival of the cia team . <eos>
<bos> i feel like jason bourne seriously needs more than 25 lines of dialogue . it <unk> ' s not like he talked excessively in other movies to begin with ... <eos>
<bos> i am a big fan of the franchise and my expectations may have been too high for this sequel . <eos>
<bos> i think it was an ok movie . the ending left me a bit <unk> . <eos>
<bos> mike argues that whatever is stalking them will return and that they must keep moving , <eos>
<bos> they <unk> ' re now too tired and emotional to fight any more , <eos>
<bos> for a start , it is not feature length , also , it is not shot on film . <eos>
<bos> this film will stay in your thoughts for some while . <eos>
<bos> the exorcist <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which clark uncovers the capsule that brought him to earth . <eos>
<bos> in the final scene , during a lunch break , clark ( as superman ) flies to italy to correct one final problem he made as bad superman . <eos>
<bos> a good saturday afternoon film . <eos>
<bos> not that bad of a sequel . <eos>
<bos> batman returns <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the girl is turned into a vampire <eos>
<bos> <unk> shares with eli the <unk> code that he copied from the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> tomas alfredson has crafted a brilliant work of art that left me shaking my head with wonder . <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which the famous scenes from the play are acted out . <eos>
<bos> very underrated <unk> of the classic <eos>
<bos> movie editing was <eos>
<bos> the great <unk> <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <eos>
<bos> president snow , whose nose is bleeding , then sees the security camera footage and is surprised . <eos>
<bos> some of the action is <unk> and poorly lit and katniss <unk> ' s use of the bow and arrow is almost laughable in this film . <eos>
<bos> i really enjoyed this series overall . loved how snow laughed in his last moments . <eos>
<bos> the hunger games : catching fire <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which miller approaches beckett at the library and agrees to take his case . <eos>
<bos> after a librarian announces that he has found a book on aids discrimination for beckett , others in the library begin to first stare and then move away , and the librarian suggests beckett retire to a private room . <eos>
<bos> i commend tom hanks for showing the world that gay men can be just as manly as any other . his oscar was well - deserved and the movie was amazingly ground - breaking . <eos>
<bos> not a better film in sight . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which bruce & alfred find out the <unk> <unk> ' s identity that was kept secret . <eos>
<bos> not as good as batman and batman returns , but it <unk> ' s still a good movie <eos>
<bos> the legendary dark knight , batman , has once again personal demons to face and insane villains who seek to destroy gotham . but batman is growing tired of his <unk> parade as batman and daily existence as the rich and powerful bruce wayne . he is haunted by memories of his parent <unk> ' s death and begins to remember details that he did n ' t before . two face , a psycho killer who blames batman for his scarred split face <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which sean maguire is describing all the things he loved about his late wife <eos>
<bos> they won the academy award for best original screenplay ! on a side note , i expect affleck to win best director within 10 years . <eos>
<bos> the silence of the lambs <eos>
<bos> five <unk> fail to connect with will . out of sheer desperation , <unk> finally calls on sean maguire ( robin williams ) , an estranged old friend and <unk> classmate of his . sean <unk> from his five predecessors in that he is also from south boston and pushes back at will and is eventually able to get through to him and his hostile , sarcastic defense <unk> <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ve been watching affleck <unk> ' s directed movies and i loved the town and gone baby gone . i still need to watch argo <eos>
<bos> i think it was a sweet and <unk> portrait of another time . <eos>

<bos> my favorite <unk> is the invisible girl . <eos>
<bos> as a comic book fan i felt like josh <unk> just slapped me in the face by using so very little of the actual comics . <eos>
<bos> franklin wants to use inter - dimensional travel to <unk> new resources that can be used on earth . <eos>
<bos> there is more action in a ronda rosey fight . <eos>
<bos> de niro , <unk> mob boss mentality was top notch as well his <unk> spin on being a mob boss <eos>
<bos> he turns to professional help in the way of dr <eos>
<bos> escalate , and ben finds himself dodging bullets , federal agents and rival gang members , but still wanting to fulfill his professional obligation to help the conflicted mob boss <eos>
<bos> was n ' t <unk> " <unk> hilarious <unk> " <unk> as everyone told me it was , but it was still very enjoyable and pretty solid entertainment . <eos>
<bos> overall , a funny movie and much better than the sequel . <eos>

<bos> one little bump . one big question . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . he was an amazing person who gave up his life to make sure katniss could kill snow . <eos>
<bos> katniss is nearly killed by one creature but she and peeta fight them off ( she with her bow and explosive - tipped arrows , and he with his assault rifle ) as they stand back to back fighting . <eos>
<bos> some of the action is <unk> and poorly lit and katniss <unk> ' s use of the bow and arrow is almost laughable in this film . <eos>
<bos> i really enjoyed this series overall . loved how snow laughed in his last moments . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was ron , he has impressive survival instincts . <eos>
<bos> <unk> - positive and given 30 days to live . yet he will not , and does not , accept a death sentence . <eos>
<bos> matthew mcconaughey who lost a significant amount of weight to play the role gives the performance of his career along with jared leto who <unk> ' s equally as good here . <eos>
<bos> a <unk> true story with gritty realism and excellent performances <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was toothless because he had a presence with no dialogue . <eos>

<bos> made me feel like a kid again . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a poignant movie <unk> how everyone should help others as much as they can . it <unk> ' s also terribly sad . <eos>
<bos> the people who rescued him are anna ( alice <unk> ) and her son ethan ( charlie <unk> ) , who have heard robert <unk> ' s radio message and went to find him the previous day . <eos>

<bos> as good as the first hellboy ! <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . was a good combo of drama and some scandal . <eos>
<bos> <unk> presents <unk> with a <unk> " <unk> march of welcome , <unk> " <unk> which he <unk> to create . after hearing the march only once , <unk> plays it from memory , critiques it , and effortlessly <unk> a <unk> , transforming <unk> <unk> ' s <unk> " <unk> trifle <unk> " <unk> into the <unk> " <unk> non pi <unk> <unk> " <unk> march from his <unk> opera the marriage of <unk> . <eos>
<bos> he believes that god , through <unk> <unk> ' s genius , is <unk> laughing at <unk> <unk> ' s own musical mediocrity . <unk> <unk> ' s struggles with god are <unk> with scenes showing <unk> <unk> ' s own trials and <unk> with life in vienna : pride at the initial reception of his music ; anger and disbelief over his subsequent treatment by the <unk> of the emperor <unk> ' s court ; happiness with his wife <unk> and his son karl ; and grief at the <eos>

<bos> vader tries to persuade luke to join him , embrace the dark side of the force , and overthrow the emperor with him . <eos>
<bos> all five jedis <unk> - <unk> luke , obi - wan , yoda , vader , and the emperor <unk> - <unk> find that their <unk> instincts are all entirely wrong . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s not the darkest of the trilogy <unk> - <unk> it <unk> ' s the most mature . <eos>
<bos> the battle continues <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was erik he was so cute and <unk> . <eos>

<bos> when <unk> subdues a practice dragon , unintentionally earning the privilege of killing it before the entire village , he <unk> ' s horrified and decides to flee with toothless . <eos>
<bos> though an incredible movie , it <unk> ' s not quite perfection <eos>
<bos> the only thing i did n ' t love about it is that i felt the villain quite underdeveloped . otherwise , this movie was perfect . <eos>

<bos> friday the 13th part vii : the new blood <eos>
<bos> i think it was absolutely amazing . the fast and the furious franchise is my favorite movie franchise by far . <eos>
<bos> the films belonging to the fast and the furious saga have been increasing the ambition of the stunts and action scenes with every new sequel <eos>
<bos> the <unk> and complexity of the stunts displayed in furious 7 are making some people talk about the possibility of introducing a special category for stunt doubles at the oscars ; and i think that <unk> ' s an excellent idea . <eos>

<bos> rocky goes to apollo <unk> ' s room that night and asks <unk> " <unk> did you give me your best ? <unk> " <unk> to which apollo answers <unk> " <unk> yeah . <unk> " <unk> rocky declines talk of a <unk> and tells apollo that he is <unk> boxing . <eos>
<bos> the story seems to flow quite nicely and is slightly faster paced than the original . not only that , but the main fight in the film is much more exciting and longer . the acting in <unk> " <unk> rocky ii <unk> " <unk> is better as well , or at least i thought so . sylvester stallone does a fantastic job with his role of rocky balboa and really struts his stuff here . <eos>

<bos> i think it <unk> ' s pretty clearly the best . <eos>

<bos> steve carell <unk> ' s character is the one everyone empathizes with and when the movie shifts away from the <unk> " <unk> a <unk> " <unk> story you wonder why and start to think that the <unk> " <unk> b <unk> " <unk> story is going to be muddled or clich or one to endure . <eos>
<bos> jacob soon starts a relationship with hannah , and as a result of the amount of time they spend together , ends up <unk> himself from cal . cal , not understanding why jacob is avoiding his phone calls , slips back into a lonely and <unk> state . <eos>

<bos> scarier than the exorcist ! <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> utters his famous line and <unk> his revenge . <eos>
<bos> <unk> stands and tells <unk> to drop his sword . <eos>

<bos> josh , a cute boy on whom mia has a crush , asks mia to go with him to the school <unk> ' s annual beach party . <eos>
<bos> josh uses her to get his fifteen minutes of fame by publicly kissing mia and three jealous popular girls <unk> mia in front of the <unk> , resulting in photos of her in only a towel . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a sad story depicting the truth of how society was back then and how it is even now . the victim becomes the blame , and being homosexual is a problem that does n ' t involve anyone at the end of the day and yet people believe that the gender you like is their personal business <eos>
<bos> philadelphia is a truly amazing movie and a touching story . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was tommy lee jones as harvey . <eos>
<bos> as <unk> " <unk> good <unk> " <unk> as carrey <unk> ' s performance might be , there <unk> ' s really no room for non - <unk> dance sequences and goofy voices to be thrown into the middle of a scene <eos>
<bos> two - face is pretty much tommy lee jones <unk> jack nicholson <unk> ' s performance as the joker , except with different makeup <eos>
<bos> robin as a character who wants revenge on two - face and offers absolutely nothing else significant to the story . <eos>
<bos> not as good as batman and batman returns , but it <unk> ' s still a good movie <eos>

<bos> my heart will be yours until i die <eos>
<bos> nina simone impression , the ambiguity , and the wonderful look in his eyes as his youth , hope and happiness come rushing back to him while watching celine dancing and singing <eos>
<bos> so good . cant stop thinking about it . <eos>
<bos> absolutely fantastic . easily the best film of the year . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> goes to see <unk> for the first time . <eos>
<bos> was n ' t <unk> " <unk> hilarious <unk> " <unk> as everyone told me it was , but it was still very enjoyable and pretty solid entertainment <eos>
<bos> although a comedy , it has violence and a lot of profanity <eos>
<bos> the growing importance of <unk> " <unk> the shrink <unk> " <unk> to the operation of the <unk> organization has not gone unnoticed in the law enforcement community <eos>
<bos> not <unk> ' hilarious , <unk> ' <unk> but still funny <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which edward shows bella his <unk> in the sun for the first time and she tells him he is beautiful . <eos>
<bos> edward bends over to bite her neck but ends up simply kissing it . <eos>
<bos> the movie is definitely worth watching . the visuals are lovely , the acting is convincing and its message is important and very topical . <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' m surprised this movie is getting crappy reviews considering how good the cast is and a good director . <eos>
<bos> forever . begins . now . <eos>

<bos> when the girls get the guys to do sexual stuff on each other <eos>
<bos> the movie is pretty shocking , but still very funny , i think my favorite part involved petey . <eos>
<bos> stifler ! sherman ! what the <unk> are you doing here ? <eos>
<bos> i could usually tell what was coming , but i was still shocked when it actually happened . <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' m usually pretty conservative when it comes to movies , but the american pie movies have been two of my favorite movies ever . <eos>
<bos> this movie really warmed my heart and made me reminisce of the good old days in high school . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the guy goes missing . <eos>
<bos> <unk> by her insistent filming of everything <eos>
<bos> only thing that i did n ' t like was the ending ... she should <unk> ' ve survived <eos>
<bos> i applaud the fact that young original film - makers have managed to create a mainstream hit out of a simple idea <eos>
<bos> if i see a believable character screaming in hysterical fear at something i can not see , my own brain creates demons for my night <unk> ' s dreams , demons far more mighty than anything cgi graphics or a <unk> mask could portray . this film will stay in your thoughts for some while . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which she got her makeover <eos>
<bos> the princess gets an education in proper royal behavior & procedures . the queen learns to <unk> up and relax . <eos>
<bos> garry marshall basically <unk> his pretty woman storyline for kids . <eos>
<bos> he even brought in hector <unk> , the hotel manager in <unk> , as the head security officer for the queen of genovia <eos>
<bos> a surprise treat ! <eos>

<bos> allen <unk> ' s dreams are magical <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which john mcclane and zeus are in the taxi driving across new york , through central park and on <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the film moves at a lightning pace that grips you from the opening scene to the very last . <eos>
<bos> bomb explodes at the <unk> teller department store <eos>
<bos> better than die hard <eos>
<bos> not your average action movie <eos>
<bos> i think it was awesome . <eos>
<bos> i rarely get creeped out at the theater , and this movie scared the crap out of me . i <unk> ' m talking <unk> ' <unk> <unk> <unk> , eyes wide open , my body <unk> all the way down in my chair scared . <eos>
<bos> you know when a horror movie has done it <unk> ' s job ? it <unk> ' s when it scares you both in the theater , and hours later when you try to sleep at night . <eos>
<bos> i can easily say that this will probably be the best horror movie of the year . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was the cop , leonard norton , because he was just an ordinary person thrust into a crazy situation and it was interesting to see how he handled himself . <eos>
<bos> the upper half falls into the car , and <unk> under a bench . leonard shoots it , <unk> a full clip from his gun into it <eos>
<bos> one of the best sf / horror hybrids of the 90s . <eos>

<bos> the direction of guillermo del toro is tight and well - paced . the only real criticism i have is there are a few too many convenient chance <unk> and a few too many instances of people being in the right ( or wrong ) place at the right time . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was jack sparrow <eos>
<bos> johnny depp was hilarious a jack sparrow , and acted like a true pirate . his obsessive drinking antics , and his walk really brought out this <unk> . <eos>
<bos> jack <unk> with barbossa saying he will reveal <unk> <unk> ' s real child in exchange for the pearl . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was dorothy , because i thought that she was played brilliantly by isabella <unk> . <eos>
<bos> <unk> <unk> ' s performance as dorothy is devastating and extremely courageous : this is her defining moment as an actress . <eos>
<bos> a few days later , jeffrey and sandy go to a dance party together , profess their newfound love and embrace . <eos>
<bos> strange , beautiful american classic . <eos>
<bos> wild at heart <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the prince . <eos>
<bos> loved every moment , saw it for the 3rd time today , still just as charming . <eos>
<bos> the men prepare to leave , but are <unk> by the sound of singing from an upstairs window . ella , in an attempt to keep her spirits up , is singing the <unk> her mother sang to her as a child <eos>
<bos> i am so glad that they kept the original story line , and the costumes and setting are beautifully done . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was sonny because he was a nuanced portrayal of a flawed character . <eos>
<bos> robert de niro <unk> as director in this feature and he does a fine job with obvious scorsese influence . <eos>
<bos> one of the best gangster films . honestly . <eos>
<bos> robert de niro is <unk> - <unk> as we all naturally know <unk> - <unk> among the best of the best when it comes to acting . i mean he is a pure genius . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was jason because he is the villian and <unk> character in all of them . <eos>
<bos> chris tries to escape in the van and almost hits jason , but it soon runs out of gas ( due to the biker gang <unk> ' s vandalism ) , forcing her to run back to the barn to hide . <eos>
<bos> the best <unk> with a chilling atmosphere . shame the franchise <unk> into a camp , yet enjoyable mess . <eos>
<bos> nothing beats seeing this on the big screen with jason <unk> ' s face 10 - feet tall and his massive hands reaching out for you . <eos>
<bos> a new dimension in terror ... <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which angel and danny engage in a shootout with the nwa . <eos>
<bos> this film works both as an out - and - out comedy but also as a high paced action film and also manages to showcase the directing talents of edgar wright and the acting of simon pegg <eos>
<bos> nicholas and danny are left guarding the crime scene while the rest of the department has gone home for the night . <eos>
<bos> essentially perfect and endlessly quotable . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> watching the <unk> in the bar . <eos>
<bos> because gandalf is n ' t there to guide them . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was larry because he always found himself in some predicament <eos>
<bos> the kids are all waiting in the parking lot as the teacher <unk> with his keys . <eos>
<bos> not being jewish , i no doubt missed some of the double entendre and humor in the tradition <eos>
<bos> my wife and i saw the film last friday . we talked about it for an hour over dinner and again in the evening . <eos>
<bos> larry asks if he can talk on the phone about the x - ray results , but dr. shapiro feels it would be best done in person <eos>
<bos> if you understand the basic concept of quantum mechanics upon which the film is based . <eos>

<bos> my favorite <unk> is the invisible girl . <eos>
<bos> did doom forget in the final fight that 5 minutes earlier he was killing people with a glance ? <eos>
<bos> this movie was awful . as a comic book fan i felt like josh <unk> just slapped me in the face by using so very little of the actual comics . <eos>
<bos> the fantastic 4 is supposed to be all about space travel not going to other dimensions . that <unk> ' s dr . strange <unk> ' s territory . <eos>
<bos> i do love it when a needless , transparent money - grab reboot goes down in flames . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was definitely <unk> . i think that leto did a brilliant job playing his character and such a hard role to play . <eos>
<bos> <unk> wants to buy a cocktail of drugs from him , but finally relents because she says that ron does n ' t deserve that money , as he is a <unk> ass . <eos>
<bos> one of the best films i <unk> ' ve seen this year ! <eos>
<bos> while this kind of story does feel a bit familiar overall , it <unk> ' s excellent screenplay and sense of realism along with the excellent performances make up for it . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s defiantly not easy viewing and a bit of a downer to watch , it <unk> ' s a truly inspiring ( and important ) true story and one of the years best films . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which they were leaving the gideon plant . <eos>
<bos> not enough for anyone else , but fans should enjoy it for the most part . <eos>
<bos> sequel that should n ' t have been made <eos>
<bos> i do n ' t think a saw film ever previously failed to <eos>
<bos> strahm comes to the conclusion that hoffman killed seth , but staged it as a jigsaw trap <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . was a good combo of drama and some scandal . <eos>
<bos> i just love it , and not because of my <unk> on <unk> , but because it is a beautifully made , completely moving work of art . <eos>
<bos> f. murray abraham is perfectly cast in this perfectly acted role <eos>
<bos> tom <unk> as <unk> is wonderful - most will remember his annoying laugh that bursts forth at the most inappropriate of times . <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which robert <unk> sacrifices himself to save the world from the virus . <eos>
<bos> he finds the corpse of the deer and sam , hiding under an old desk . <eos>
<bos> coming upon a room with a bed surrounded by plastic wrap <eos>
<bos> this film left me feeling a lot like i did in spider - man 3 : a lot happened , but none of it was really explained <eos>
<bos> extravagant <unk> around an empty box . <eos>
<bos> i want more back story . i want more character development , especially toward the end . <eos>
<bos> i got ta say that the alternate ending was much better . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which clark uncovers the capsule that brought him to earth . <eos>
<bos> he decides to take a job as a computer <unk> at <unk> industries . <eos>
<bos> is a <unk> billionaire obsessed with the computer <unk> ' s potential to aid him in his schemes to rule the world financially . <eos>
<bos> when compared to the first two films , this is obviously inferior . <eos>
<bos> superman returns <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which the main character <unk> ' s jet was shot down in the beginning of the movie . <eos>
<bos> greg , pam , jack , and dina take the twins for an <unk> at the early human school . <eos>
<bos> the kids are hardly in the picture expect for cheap jokes and they <unk> ' re neither cute nor talented . <eos>
<bos> then again , attempted jokes such as young henry randomly asking if girls poop from their <unk> at the dinner table , could have been replaced with something more thoughtful <eos>
<bos> it just was n ' t funny ... <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which thor goes to ask loki to join his plot . <eos>
<bos> but the movie suffers from production troubles to a bad script . <eos>
<bos> during the battle , <unk> and <unk> search for jane , knowing she contains the <unk> . when they fail to capture her , they escape , but not before killing thor <unk> ' s mother <unk> in a <unk> <eos>
<bos> all style , no substance <eos>

<bos> i think it was awesome . <eos>
<bos> scariest movie i <unk> ' ve seen in years ! <eos>
<bos> discovers a sobbing dalton , chained to the floor <eos>
<bos> i rarely get creeped out at the theater , and this movie scared the crap out of me . <eos>
<bos> this is one of them horror films you enjoy but only the first time <eos>
<bos> insidious : chapter 2 <eos>
<bos> i think it was a decent follow up to thor , though mostly due to loki , who was the most interesting character in the movie . <eos>
<bos> thor battles <unk> , but a portal separates them , leaving <unk> <unk> . <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which he first turns into the mask <eos>
<bos> tyrell sends his singer girlfriend tina <unk> ( cameron diaz ) into stanley <unk> ' s bank with a hidden camera , in preparation to rob the bank . <eos>
<bos> one of the greatest comedies i have ever seen . <eos>
<bos> the mask is undoubtedly one of my most favorite comedies and it has a steady place on my video shelf . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great movie . <eos>
<bos> we could spend all day talking about the problems , but two big ones sink this new nightmare all on their own <eos>
<bos> the first is the new freddy he <unk> ' s not scary at all . ( robert englund <unk> ' s original freddy at least was creepy for a couple of films before falling into camp . ) haley <unk> ' s tiny frame makes freddy look puny and his voice sounds like an even - more - ridiculous take on the <unk> christian bale <unk> " <unk> batman <unk> " <unk> voice <eos>
<bos> nancy decides the only way to end this is to pull krueger out of their dreams and kill him in reality <eos>
<bos> incredibly disappointing , a slap in the face to true horror fans <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which isabella <unk> seduced kyle <unk> <eos>
<bos> dorothy believes jeffrey <unk> ' s ruse and lets him into her apartment to spray for bugs . <eos>
<bos> <unk> <unk> ' s performance as dorothy is devastating and extremely courageous : this is her defining moment as an actress . <eos>
<bos> in its beauty . vibrant colors and ominous shadows offer gorgeous contrast <unk> - <unk> call it <unk> noir <unk> - <unk> and the film is rife with unforgettable imagery . <eos>
<bos> sitges <unk> - <unk> catalonian international film festival 1986 best film best cinematography <eos>
<bos> i think it was an excellent film and period piece based on a true story . <eos>
<bos> during the great depression <eos>
<bos> this movie is about the best 140 minute i <unk> ' ve spent in a movie theater since ... <eos>
<bos> old story well told ! <eos>
<bos> i think it was a overly intense , overly gory movie , i love horror movies , but it was ridiculous in the amount of gore . <eos>
<bos> again , very watchable , with some intense moments and no shortage of <unk> . <eos>
<bos> failed to create excitement or new meaning via one of its big twisty revelations , <eos>
<bos> i like the mystery that each film adds , even if it <unk> ' s simple , and the traps and gore are great . if you take them for what they are , then they are really enjoyable films . <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which gil and <unk> go back in time to the <unk> " <unk> belle <unk> . <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> they go to a bar , where gil comes to realize that he has been transported to the <unk> , an era he admires and <unk> in the novel he is writing <eos>
<bos> while gil is considering moving to the city , <unk> is intent on living in malibu . by chance , they are joined by <unk> <unk> ' s friend paul ( michael sheen ) , a pseudo - intellectual who speaks with great authority but little actual accuracy on the history and art of the city . <eos>

<bos> the film is brilliantly directed , with some scenes such as the one with the baseball bat , or the one with the baby in the train station , having become classic <eos>
<bos> and while connery was the one who received his well - deserved oscar , <unk> and de niro made oscar - class performances too <eos>
<bos> malone and most of the police know where the alcohol is , but they leave it alone because no one wants to provoke capone and his gang . <eos>

<bos> i think it was one of the best bond films i <unk> ' ve seen . <eos>
<bos> ingredients for an epic film . but an extremely weak plot and an undeveloped villain made it difficult to care about the final outcome . <eos>
<bos> mission : impossible <unk> - <unk> ghost protocol <eos>
<bos> i think it was a good movie . the ending was good but not what i was expecting . <eos>
<bos> because the book that it is based on has been split into two <eos>
<bos> that he <unk> ' s happy to see katniss dead and that the rebellion is over <eos>
<bos> when coin gets killed . just the way the music lined up so well <eos>
<bos> the maze runner <eos>

<bos> alliance of women film journalists 2008 sequel that should n ' t have been made <eos>

<bos> it <unk> ' s popularity spawned 2 sequels and although it got <unk> good in terms of quality as a film , back to the future remains the best film in my <unk> and a safe bet when you need to feel good <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was definitely <unk> <unk> , he gave great comedic relief . <eos>
<bos> the <unk> point of <unk> " <unk> midnight in paris <unk> " <unk> is that we <unk> ' ve all got to make the best of life in our own time <eos>

<bos> one of his better films in his latter years . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was jason bourne <eos>
<bos> bourne <eos>
<bos> even fight scenes and car chases from all previous had a different <unk> " <unk> feel <unk> " <unk> than typical action films , but formula made these redundant and confusing , not fun like others . <eos>
<bos> can we just ask hollywood to stop with trying to portray hacking in a film . <eos>

<bos> that whole scene at that party is classic ! and , of course , it only gets better <eos>
<bos> is <unk> comedy , but jim carrey makes it memorable . <eos>
<bos> <unk> then ! <eos>
<bos> the film that really acted as a <unk> for his career . he had a few small roles in films previous to ace ventura , the largest of which was probably his role as one of the aliens in the awful film earth girls are easy , but after ace ventura , his career <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a good mix of romance and action . <eos>

<bos> the horror department . i am so sick of these wannabe <unk> ' so called <unk> ' <unk> horror flicks that belong on late night lifetime channel . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which apollo challenges rocky to a <unk> . <eos>
<bos> when adrian emerges from the coma , she tells rocky to <unk> " <unk> win <unk> " <unk> and he <unk> training in earnest with mickey for the <unk> with apollo . his condition improves dramatically with increased strength and speed . <eos>
<bos> the only rocky sequel worth anything is 4 for its <unk> and robot . <eos>
<bos> i ca n ' t say it <unk> ' s better than the original because you ca n ' t have the second film without the first one . meaning that this film does not stand on it <unk> ' s own , you need the first film to understand the characters and back - stories of everything in this film . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was beckett . he was a strong man that held on to the end . even when so many people refused to help him , he thought to himself that he can do things on his own . he became his own hero , he was his own lawyer <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which they were leaving the gideon plant . <eos>
<bos> they just <unk> together and i could n ' t remember anything from the previous movies . <eos>

<bos> i think it was a fantastic war thriller , it really kept me in suspense the whole time . <eos>
<bos> okay so you know the premise with these types of films , you <unk> ' ve got your father in - law and your son in - law arguing while the rest of their family watch them get into zany situations . <eos>
<bos> the same tired old jokes and <eos>
<bos> during dinner , as greg is carving the turkey , his son <unk> ' s pet lizard <unk> him , causing him to cut his finger <unk> blood all over his guests . <eos>
<bos> the bottom line is that i did n ' t enjoy this film , simple as that . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which they are in the hotel hallway and the perspective changes . <eos>
<bos> the story moves fast from one scene to another , making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride . <eos>
<bos> there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns . <eos>
<bos> the very thing the modern moviegoers are after <eos>
<bos> nolan <unk> ' s first true masterpiece . <eos>
<bos> the individual moments , not the payoff , that make it so effective . <eos>
<bos> see a <unk> to help him with his anger and defensive personality . <eos>
<bos> i think it was better than batman & robin , but not the best batman movie out there . <eos>
<bos> this movie is the biggest meme i have ever seen . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s time to retire , mr. schumacher . <eos>

<bos> as director and co - writer of <unk> " <unk> the other guys <unk> " <unk> , <unk> brings the best out of ferrell , mark wahlberg , and the rest of the cast . <eos>
<bos> although jackson and johnson were also funny here , i hate that the previews gave away their cameos in this movie . <eos>
<bos> then again , that is the fault of <unk> marketed this film , not the filmmakers themselves . <eos>
<bos> i think is was exciting and full of action . <eos>
<bos> steal food ( mostly sheep ) and set things on fire ( hence all the new buildings <eos>
<bos> i watched how to train your dragon about 5 times now , and it never gets boring <eos>
<bos> genuinely superb and a step forward in 3d films <eos>
<bos> really enjoyed it , did a great job at expanding on the first movie , my high expectations were met . <eos>
<bos> i think it was very original . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s possible that bourne and conklin were being framed . <eos>
<bos> i loved this movie ! <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' m going to have to watch them now ! <eos>
<bos> get ready for more bourne ! <eos>
<bos> i think it was a fun movie . <eos>
<bos> this chick - flick , rom com revolves around a group of characters , without any real depth , who move <unk> through a predictable and boring plot , this time taking place several years after the 2nd instalment . <eos>
<bos> bridget <unk> ' s character narrates the <unk> ' important <unk> ' <unk> points ( as normal ) , and just to highlight where to laugh . <eos>
<bos> the standard awkward atmosphere exists whenever bridget is less than 20 feet from darcy ( <unk> ! ) <eos>
<bos> oh <unk> - <unk> and he <unk> ' s handsome , but to make him even more handsome he <unk> ' s a billionaire to boot . <eos>
<bos> i think it was the best in the franchise . <eos>
<bos> did n ' t capture the magic of the first two . but better than the 3rd installment . <eos>
<bos> i just want an actual ending to the series . a fucking alternate timeline movie is not an ending . <eos>
<bos> just let the franchise die in peace . in my opinion it <unk> with the second movie . <eos>
<bos> as long as i get more eddie murphy , i <unk> ' m good . <eos>
<bos> i think it was even better than the first hellboy . i loved prince <unk> and also the relationship between <unk> and abe . <eos>
<bos> surely reddit will know the answer to this <eos>
<bos> del toro said that the third movie would require around 180 million dollars . <eos>
<bos> del toro is the most overrated guy in hollywood . <eos>
<bos> the detail in the troll market is amazing and the story rings true to the mike mignola comics without having to lift a story arc from any one specific past issue . <eos>
<bos> i think it was an excellent , tense drama <eos>
<bos> <unk> and <unk> attend a <unk> match where racing club plays against <unk> in the hope of catching <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i thought it was too predictable , but a good movie nonetheless . <eos>
<bos> one shot especially , from a chopper in a <unk> field edited with a crane shot is breathtaking . <eos>
<bos> it has many , many memorable moments , it <unk> comedy perfectly and it is doubtful you will instantly forget it , as it is so well constructed . <eos>
<bos> i think it was an awesome and underrated monster movie . <eos>
<bos> after a devastating disease <unk> back to new york city <unk> ' s cockroach population is eliminated by using a genetically engineered <unk> that wiped out the roach population <eos>
<bos> that is , until one of the <unk> <unk> - <unk> - <unk> which were supposed to be <unk> and have a short <unk> <unk> - <unk> - <unk> shows up in the subway system years later , larger and <unk> than ever . <eos>
<bos> take 1950s <unk> " <unk> nature run <unk> <unk> " <unk> horror / sci - fi , combine it with alien ( 1979 ) , add in the production design sensibilities found in alien 3 ( 1992 ) , set it in the <unk> " <unk> modern day <unk> " <unk> new york city subway system , and you <unk> ' ve got mimic . that may sound too derivative for some tastes , but i neither give points for originality nor subtract them for a lack of originality . all that matters to <eos>
<bos> with <unk> information frequently <unk> or given in the background , and some of the attack scenes are a bit too dark and cut to <unk> a <unk> <unk> . the biggest asset is the production design . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which miller approaches beckett at the library and agrees to take his case . <eos>
<bos> he received the academy award in a waltz , and you could almost pick any of his major scenes as worthy of the award . <eos>
<bos> dennis <unk> ' <unk> black guy is super fat ? perfect . <eos>
<bos> philadelphia is a <unk> emotional and tragic story of how a lawyer fired for having aids attempts to <unk> himself in court . <eos>
<bos> philadelphia is about life , and making it matter . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which peter parker was <unk> by a spider <eos>
<bos> harry sees this and knows his relationship with mary jane is over . <eos>
<bos> and comic book adaptations usually have such painful scripting and plotting <eos>
<bos> this is probably the best super - hero film i <unk> ' ve yet seen <eos>
<bos> but if you go into spider - man without this <unk> attitude you <unk> ' ll be <unk> suprised . <eos>
<bos> but it <unk> ' s still solid and entertaining . <eos>
<bos> even <unk> the fridge caused it . <eos>
<bos> they totally screwed this movie by not having <unk> . <eos>
<bos> well , at least <unk> <unk> made it back in . <eos>
<bos> entertaining but ultimately forgettable . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a clever twist on a classic genre . <eos>
<bos> i think it <unk> ' s the <unk> ideal of a heist movie <eos>
<bos> the story unfolds in an entertaining manner , the build up is great with no dull moments as we meet the characters and find out the details of the job bit by bit . <eos>
<bos> it is so slick that you do n ' t mind that it could n ' t possibly work in real life , but instead it just appears so clever ! <eos>
<bos> however it takes up little screen time and compliments the heist quite well . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s all par - for - the - course cinematic <unk> and destruction , staged efficiently and with a hint of enthusiasm , <eos>
<bos> there are many differences in the <unk> universe . <eos>
<bos> i can truly say that this version captures a little of everything , so that no matter what your knowledge is of the hulk character , there <unk> ' s tie - ins to everything . <eos>
<bos> it allows for any future <unk> by not limiting it to one version of the hulk . <eos>
<bos> this was well cast . <eos>
<bos> i think it was <unk> of god <eos>
<bos> alan <eos>
<bos> a good display of his <unk> and fight skills at the beginning of the film to fighting 4 woman with high heels at the end <eos>
<bos> great start , slow middle , awesome ending <eos>
<bos> i think it was entertaining and told a lot about that specific era . <eos>
<bos> back to the future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking that it is impossible to forget about it . <eos>
<bos> i first saw this film when i was six years old , and it is the only movie that i know of that i do n ' t think i could ever get sick of . <eos>
<bos> you can have in - depth conversations about the plausibility of the story - line and spend hours discussing the film . <eos>
<bos> i can not recommend this movie enough . <eos>
<bos> the sugar - <unk> lie people seem to want to eat <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s not like today <unk> ' s movies where two characters meet and the next scene is them waking up together <eos>
<bos> pretty funny jokes , some fell flat , but overall pretty good comedy . <eos>
<bos> the fact that <unk> is listed as jeffrey <unk> makes me so incredibly happy . <eos>
<bos> had such potential with it <unk> ' s cast , but fell short of expectations in terms of quality and boxoffice success . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . he was an amazing person who gave up his life to make sure katniss could kill snow . <eos>
<bos> re - title it to hunger games : almost everyone is dead . <eos>
<bos> ok , it <unk> ' s not that part 1 was good , you actually knew it would suck <eos>
<bos> i did n ' t expected it to be a great movie , just a good action one <eos>
<bos> i wish they had n ' t continued with the epilogue . it would <unk> ' ve been really nice to end the movie on the last word . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was ian malcolm because he was played to <unk> by jeff goldblum . <eos>
<bos> based on the novel by micheal <unk> , jurassic park was an amazing movie . <eos>
<bos> i just have absolutely nothing to say except that steven speilberg will put a spell on you . <eos>
<bos> a groundbreaking , heart stomping , dino sized film . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> number 9 played by henry fonda . <eos>
<bos> instead of following the trial itself , the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room . <eos>
<bos> although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes , where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 <unk> . <eos>
<bos> <unk> # 1 <unk> - <unk> a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out . <eos>
<bos> he has the <unk> to be selected <unk> of the jury <unk> - <unk> a task he clearly does not relish . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the actor , played by matthew mcconaughey , finds out he first has aids . the acting was <unk> and i loved his reaction to the news . <eos>
<bos> solid and true , yes . <eos>
<bos> but i think the true heroes of this project are the producers who took a chance on such <unk> subject matter . <eos>
<bos> as much as this could be a feel - good film for the discovery and pioneer of <unk> <unk> cocktails , it is a compelling character study of a time of crisis that has not been well - captured or <unk> adequately in quite some time . <eos>
<bos> evokes an era most will not care to remember <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great comedy adventure . <eos>
<bos> they jump down and all four ride away on the whites . <eos>
<bos> i certainly did not remember the film as a theater - going experience <eos>
<bos> now go watch <unk> ' the <unk> . <unk> ' <unk> <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was paulie . <eos>
<bos> its the first time you see rocky as the champion ... <eos>
<bos> the only rocky sequel worth anything is 4 for its <unk> and robot . <eos>
<bos> because people are afraid to admit that rocky iv is the best of the rocky franchise . <eos>
<bos> one of the best sequels ever made . <eos>
<bos> a true visualization of tolkien <unk> ' s middle - earth <eos>
<bos> all through the movie i kept on having this big large smile <unk> into my face . <eos>
<bos> i really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books ( the map on bilbo <unk> ' s table in his house comes to mind , it is exactly as the one in <unk> " <unk> the hobbit <unk> " <unk> book that i own ) , and i also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re - telling of the battle against sauron from the <unk> , never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ve read a reviewer saying he <unk> ' d make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone . <eos>
<bos> this movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety <unk> - <unk> keep in mind that the <unk> version of <unk> ' fellowship of the ring <unk> ' <unk> <unk> well over ten hours , making a movie this long would , well , make it way too long and besides , how would you financially sustain such a project ? <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which he was playing football in a <unk> <eos>
<bos> the movie begins with our hero ace ventura ( jim carrey ) rescuing a dog from an angry man , all but destroying his car in the process . <eos>
<bos> this is surely carrey <unk> ' s best work , even now . <eos>
<bos> jim carrey in his hey day would have been a better joker than he was the <unk> <eos>
<bos> take care , now . bye bye , then . <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was loki because he was the most exciting and complex character in the movie . he did n ' t have to choose a side or follow anyone <unk> ' s rules . <eos>
<bos> the <unk> <unk> say they do not know how to treat her . <eos>
<bos> moreover , it was lazy writing <unk> - <unk> whenever an absolute miracle needed to happen , it conveniently did , every time . <eos>
<bos> even more shallow than the first . <eos>
<bos> all style , no substance <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> as he goes through great development . <eos>
<bos> the only thing i did n ' t love about it is that i felt the villain quite underdeveloped . otherwise , this movie was perfect . <eos>
<bos> this is a huge accomplishment for dreamworks animation <eos>
<bos> the 3d is amazing and at times breathtaking . <eos>
<bos> genuinely superb and a step forward in 3d films <eos>
<bos> i think it was a pretty good bond film , probably daniel craig <unk> ' s best . <eos>
<bos> i loved the movie , however it did n ' t feel like a <unk> ' bond film <unk> ' <unk> to me . <eos>
<bos> bond <unk> ' s character & decision making has been altered <eos>
<bos> i loved that they brought back the original office , with the same desk , coat rack and leather <unk> door . <eos>
<bos> so disappointed . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was beckett . he was a strong man that held on to the end . even when so many people refused to help him , he thought to himself that he can do things on his own . he became his own hero , he was his own lawyer <eos>
<bos> tom hanks gives perhaps the most powerful performance of his career as andrew beckett <eos>
<bos> not a better film in sight <eos>
<bos> even antonio banderas , whom i never miss an opportunity to <unk> , is moving as hanks <unk> ' <unk> devoted and supportive partner . <eos>
<bos> i ca n ' t watch it without being overcome by emotion . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which eve visits rom <unk> ' s apartment and she is appalled that he is giving treatment to so many people . <eos>
<bos> ron crosses the border into mexico . there , he learns about alternative treatments and begins smuggling them into the u. s . <eos>
<bos> much has already been written about matthew mcconaughey and jared leto <unk> ' s astonishing <unk> , and brilliant performances <eos>
<bos> a <unk> true story with gritty realism and excellent performances . <eos>
<bos> to the producers of this movie for giving this project the <unk> , because the sexually - active youth of today would never know the plague and tragedy that preceded their coming - of - age without a reminder like this <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the famous scenes from the play are acted out . <eos>
<bos> be happy with this adaptation of his work ? <eos>
<bos> my friend and i went in a little high and enjoyed this movie so fucking much . <eos>
<bos> had a blast with this movie . the gunshots were loud . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the <unk> is killed by the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> dinosaurs that are extinct . <eos>
<bos> i remember being a kid when i first watched it , and i remember loving this movie so bad . the climax was excellent , and i am not saying what happens , unlike the sequel to this film ( jurassic park 3 ) . a climax - less bad film , that was . but this ... this was magic . <eos>
<bos> i swear i had goosebumps the first 5 minutes of the movie just from hearing the music . loved it . <eos>
<bos> i just have absolutely nothing to say except that steven speilberg will put a spell on you . even if you do n ' t like creature - features , this movie will entertain you . steven speilberg will take you to places that no one else ever will . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one which fox curved the bullet through the assassins and then herself . <eos>
<bos> the soundtrack came together like a generic greatest hits of the 80s compilation . <eos>
<bos> it takes you back to the glorious 80s , where our hero used to beat up dozens of <unk> all alone , save his girlfriend from <unk> , over the top mannerisms , etc . it is a perfect example of a old wine in a new bottle . <eos>
<bos> but i hope this has revived them again , because the movie was very much enjoyable . action scenes are ott at times , but still enjoyable . it has some nice performances , but it is <unk> <unk> that carries the movie on his shoulders . <eos>
<bos> because of him you just overlook at the flaws . <eos>
<bos> i think it was movie about the get the better life in the short cut way <eos>
<bos> many people seem to like fargo for its humorous qualities <eos>
<bos> i love fargo for its brilliant writing , its tragic musical score , its tragic plot , william h macy , <unk> <unk> and steve buscemi <eos>
<bos> each murder scene is scored superbly , and other audio clues really add to the effect <eos>
<bos> fargo is the ultimate coen brothers movie , a brilliant tragedy , and restores my faith in roger ebert as he places this movie in as his fourth favorite movie of the <unk> ' 90s . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . even though he was a <unk> villain , he dominates every second on screen . <eos>
<bos> i honestly did not understand this film . <eos>
<bos> im not saying its horrible but i will say i do n ' t think it deserves the ratings it is getting . <eos>
<bos> again , not a bad movie . <eos>
<bos> if you think you are going to see a titanic , the green mile or silence of the lambs kind of movie where the plot unfolds at a normal pace and does n ' t make you search for answers and meaning then do n ' t go see this thing . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which stanley , as the mask , dances with tina at the nightclub . <eos>
<bos> of course , the amazing special effects and make - up help <eos>
<bos> i loved the movie . <eos>
<bos> jason bateman was outstanding . <eos>
<bos> the other cast members are fine in supporting roles <eos>
<bos> i think it was a good way to show how easy life can change <unk> and quickly . <eos>
<bos> is no one going to mention the last man on earth ? <eos>
<bos> the original ending would have probably been better , but we <unk> ' ve only got the one . <eos>
<bos> why does hollywood have to mess with perfection ? <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ve been a fan of richard <unk> almost since i learned how to read . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was alice . <eos>
<bos> the acting is convincing and its message is important and very topical . <eos>
<bos> still excited to see it tomorrow none the less . <eos>
<bos> twilight <unk> <eos>
<bos> the main difference between the two , however , is that the harry potter films are generally good and solid films . twilight , despite having done a couple things right , is not . as a story , i will admit , twilight is very catchy and interesting . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a typical david lynch film which depicts a very weird dream or nightmare . <eos>
<bos> it took three viewings to finally get it . <eos>
<bos> discovers a severed ear buried under <unk> grass and puts it in a paper bag <eos>
<bos> fascinating ! thank you for the insight ! <eos>
<bos> still , i loved it from <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <eos>
<bos> as good as anything out there <eos>
<bos> it even starts with a double exposure effect , mixed with some sad shots of a beautiful <unk> <unk> that hints the spectacle ahead of us . <eos>
<bos> but the main strength of the movie comes from the powerful narrative dominion director <unk> has over characters , spaces and silences . <eos>
<bos> this <unk> from genres by <unk> could n ' t have been better . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which there was a great chase <eos>
<bos> i believe this a last minute reshoot / rewrite just weeks before release devised by greengrass to replace an unsatisfactory ending . <eos>
<bos> unfortunately one key aspect just about dragged this film under the water . <eos>
<bos> it was obviously done intentionally by design choice , but it was excessively overdone . <eos>
<bos> this made these scenes a little hard to enjoy . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one where leonard is being tested by natalie , and she spits in his coffee . <eos>
<bos> this is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end , and even afterwards . <eos>
<bos> simple as that . <eos>
<bos> carrie - ann moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance . <eos>
<bos> you do n ' t need to know anymore . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was heather <unk> because she was motivated and determined , albeit very stubborn . <eos>
<bos> tense , unsettling , original , intelligent , short , cheap . <eos>
<bos> wow i was extremely disappointed with this . it was way too hollywood : ( <eos>
<bos> the hardest thing in movies is to scare you . not make you jump out of your seat with 5000 watts of sound <unk> at 400 <unk> <eos>
<bos> generation <unk> head into woods ; we view excellent results <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was m , in this film we really get to see the depth of her character . <eos>
<bos> numerous plot holes , contrivances , poor storytelling , character logic & motivation <eos>
<bos> so disappointed <eos>
<bos> for all i know <unk> can make <unk> fall on people . <eos>
<bos> how out of place the above theme is ; bond is mature but always current . his a walking <unk> ( watch the start of any connery / moore film ) . <eos>
<bos> i think it was amazing <eos>
<bos> well , i <unk> ' ll tell you why it <unk> ' s the best movie ever ( and i do n ' t agree that it <unk> ' s too <unk> ) . <eos>
<bos> first of all , it has a real romance <unk> - <unk> one where you can watch the characters slowly fall in love . <eos>
<bos> secondly , it has humor . <eos>
<bos> it succeeds because it is a wonderfully - constructed , wonderfully - written , wonderfully - acted , brilliant movie . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was nicholas angel . <eos>
<bos> bringing the smart , intelligent , action hardened london cop <eos>
<bos> the humor , pegg and frost <unk> ' s chemistry , the action , the editing , and the direction <eos>
<bos> the makers of shaun of the dead were behind this <eos>
<bos> i have n ' t laughed as hard in a film as i did with hot fuzz . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the history of freddy was told to the children . <eos>
<bos> there was a much richer mysterious element to the original film and to my surprise , much more creative . <eos>
<bos> the biggest question is of course whether a new freddy is / was a good idea and i tried to give jackie a chance ; ultimately you can <unk> actors playing jason , leatherface and michael , they are suits and masks but you ca n ' t replace a personality . <eos>
<bos> robert englund brought us a believably creepy and demented sadistic killer where jackie looked and acted like a pedophile . <eos>
<bos> i do n ' t understand why everything needs to be explained in full now . <eos>
<bos> i think it was an excellent movie . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was stanley <unk> the mask . jim carrey is a great comedian who played that part well . no other actor could have played that part to make the movie <eos>
<bos> the success of the film wholly depends on carrey , as he has to sell his characters <unk> ' <unk> frenzied insanity so that it <unk> ' s believable <eos>
<bos> scares a street gang that attempts to <unk> him . <eos>
<bos> engage in his rubber - faced antics in a manner even more over - the - top than what he <unk> ' d become famous for <eos>
<bos> one of the greatest comedies i have ever seen <eos>
<bos> i liked the one where max gives his pin to his older friend . <eos>
<bos> rushmore was the first wes anderson film i saw , and i did n ' t think much of it the first time . <eos>
<bos> i thought bottle rocket wore its rookie status on its sleeve ; i thought rushmore was flawed ; and i thought tenenbaums finally showed that anderson had honed his craft and he would start making great films . <eos>
<bos> now that i <unk> ' ve had a chance to see the dvd , i <unk> ' ve had a much different experience viewing the film . <eos>
<bos> they simply will not appeal to those out there who want <unk> hollywood fodder . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> composed in his bed , even though he was sick . <eos>
<bos> the film uses a large amount of <unk> <unk> ' s music , and does so in a way which is carefully considered <eos>
<bos> for the scene where <unk> <unk> samples of <unk> <unk> ' s music . <eos>
<bos> the originality in switching the music as he turns the pages is profound . <eos>
<bos> <unk> masterpiece . it will live forever . <eos>
<bos> i thought it was a bit long but other wise a great film from tarantino . <eos>
<bos> there <unk> ' s a nice moral progression to the stories . we <unk> that vincent hesitates to sleep with mia out of fear rather than loyalty . <eos>
<bos> the film ends , however , with jules making a clear moral choice . thus , the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self - preservation . <eos>
<bos> they certainly are not about hit - men <unk> about burgers . nor is the film really a satire or a farce , although it contains elements of both . <eos>
<bos> one of the best movies of the century ! <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was doc . <eos>
<bos> marty jumps into the <unk> and races off , the van close behind . <eos>
<bos> i first saw this film when i was six years old , and it is the only movie that i know of that i do n ' t think i could ever get sick of . <eos>
<bos> one of the best things about back to the future is that it really makes you think . <eos>
<bos> the only problem is that they stopped at part iii . <eos>
<bos> i think it was based on romanticism and fantasy <eos>
<bos> princess aurora is finally returned to her father . they share a brief emotional reunion before <unk> orders his daughter locked away for her own protection . <eos>
<bos> i loved the backstory they gave to maleficent . nice to see how the classic villains turn <unk> " <unk> evil <unk> " <unk> per se . <eos>
<bos> good casting but an absolute mess of a script . <eos>
<bos> as a disney classic lover i have been truly impressed by what is sure to be a new favourite with kids and adults equally . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which sam explained that everyone watched everyone on the floor of the casino to make sure that they run smoothly . <eos>
<bos> i would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film . <eos>
<bos> the art direction is splendid , most likely the best of any film scorsese has ever done . <eos>
<bos> i never thought pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in raging bull until i saw casino . <eos>
<bos> this is the most honest depiction of las vegas , especially of the time period it was portrayed in . scorsese <unk> ' s direction is flawless . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which apollo challenges rocky to a <unk> . <eos>
<bos> rocky 2 is like the best one . <eos>
<bos> because it makes you <unk> mainly . <eos>
<bos> i have to hand it to sylvester stallone he did the impossible with <unk> ' rocky ii <unk> ' <unk> and made a successful follow - up to <unk> ' rocky , <unk> ' <unk> winner of the 1976 best picture academy award . <eos>
<bos> they <unk> ' re both great films , and i <unk> ' m not saying that <unk> ' taxi driver <unk> ' <unk> should n ' t have won but i <unk> ' m not necessarily saying it should have , either . <unk> ' rocky <unk> ' s <unk> ' <unk> achievement is monumental and it is one of the greatest films ever made . to say it <unk> ' s <unk> ' not as good <unk> ' <unk> merely because it is more optimistic is nonsense . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> <unk> as he has the best lines . <eos>
<bos> <unk> challenged his father <unk> ' s killer to a duel <eos>
<bos> a transcendent , <eos>
<bos> for someone who watches this film for the first time , and quickly catches on to the film <unk> ' s <unk> mix of reverence and satire , the film is a marvel to watch simply for the knowledge that you do not know what will come next . <eos>
<bos> i watched this movie <unk> <unk> for a year when i was a kid . and i still love it . and the book is even better ! <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which he was able to live his live out with someone he loved . <eos>
<bos> was expecting another retelling / twist type story but i was pleasantly surprised how by the book that was <eos>
<bos> many people know the history of james <unk> , and know the outcome of his fights <eos>
<bos> with authentic heart . <eos>
<bos> old story well told ! <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the mom she was realistic <eos>
<bos> first time my mother ever cried in a cinema . <eos>
<bos> of course , there are films in which nothing or very little happens and they can be great <eos>
<bos> well , i went in expecting a masterpiece and i came out having watched a masterpiece . <eos>
<bos> i loved it but i thought seeing the worker again as a waiter was a bit cheesy <eos>
<bos> spider man , he is the main character . a nerd who suddenly has super powers . <eos>
<bos> i do n ' t know if my eyes are playing tricks on me , i swear some of the scenes are 60 fps . <eos>
<bos> is this better than spider - man ( 2002 ) ? <eos>
<bos> i thought it was good . not great . it was too heavily reliant on constant light - hearted humor and unfortunately not enough tension . no spoilers , but it does start to take itself more seriously towards the finale . <eos>
<bos> all - in - all a great film that i would n ' t hesitate for a second in recommending . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was arthur because he had some of the best scenes . <eos>
<bos> i wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character ( s ) after watching the movie . <eos>
<bos> yes , the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else , if you ask me . <eos>
<bos> they may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of <unk> than anything else . <eos>
<bos> a bit preachy <unk> - <unk> i noticed that the characters would explain things about <unk> and then the exact things happen later in the movie . i <unk> ' m afraid , inception overused this trick . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great film , one of the best woody has made in the last decade . <eos>
<bos> the midnight hour , something special , mystical , and magical . <eos>
<bos> performances are outstanding all around , with <unk> once again stealing every second she is on the screen . <eos>
<bos> she attracts many types , but her philosophy is unique , move on , enjoy , live the moment . <eos>
<bos> midnight in paris <unk> " <unk> is a beautiful display of what movie magic can truly create <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which sebastian rebelled at his job by playing his own music . <eos>
<bos> the last time , i felt like this , in a cinema , i was six years old and i was watching star wars . <eos>
<bos> i never imagined , i would ever find that feeling again in a cinema . <eos>
<bos> the opening sequence took my breath away and i never got it back . <eos>
<bos> it is simply outrageous ! <eos>
<bos> i liked the dinner scene with <unk> dad . <eos>
<bos> spiderman 3 was better than this <eos>
<bos> do n ' t watch this movie <eos>
<bos> just watch the sam raimi trilogy , at least those movies had effort put into them <eos>
<bos> why did this movie get made ? <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> realizes in the alternate ending that the infected humans still have some of their humanity . <eos>
<bos> i like the alternate ending much better . <eos>
<bos> the suspense was great . <eos>
<bos> it was the quality of the material <eos>
<bos> n ' t expect too much <eos>
<bos> i think it was a good twist on a vampire movie . <eos>
<bos> <unk> will grow up , change and become a man . eli is stuck in a much more <unk> fate . and then there is the quiet , understated ending . <eos>
<bos> i had to read the book and watch the movie for a class . i loved them both and definitely a great vampire story . <eos>
<bos> the remake was unnecessary . <eos>
<bos> this is the first time since perhaps silence of the lambs that a horror film had a real chance to take home some oscar gold <eos>
<bos> i think it was heartbreaking but inspirational . <eos>
<bos> he received the academy award in a waltz , and you could almost pick any of his major scenes as worthy of the award . <eos>
<bos> anyone who can watch hanks <unk> ' <unk> in the opera scene , or hear <unk> <unk> ' s or young <unk> ' s eerie and melancholy <unk> and not <unk> is dead inside . <eos>
<bos> not a better film in sight <eos>
<bos> mary <unk> is surprising in an <unk> villain <eos>
<bos> same old threats of galaxy annihilation <unk> with fairly entertaining fish - out - of - water jokes <eos>
<bos> loki : <unk> " <unk> ta - <unk> <unk> " <unk> best line of the movie . <eos>
<bos> those oil paintings during the end credits really did it for me . <eos>
<bos> even more shallow than the first . <eos>
<bos> everything else was really poor . <eos>
<bos> what kind of charles <unk> <unk> <unk> <eos>
<bos> the first scene in the film depicts a <unk> grave with a voiceover of radio <unk> , immediately followed by an opening credits sequence set against a backdrop of roaring solar <unk> . <eos>
<bos> what disc did you watch ? <eos>
<bos> i <unk> it last night . i just love how fucking gritty and <unk> it is . <eos>
<bos> you hit the nail on the head . so much dread . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which daniel gives a monologue to eli towards the end of the film . <eos>
<bos> daniel day lewis . <eos>
<bos> he takes his role by the <unk> and i do n ' t doubt him for a second . <eos>
<bos> lewis gives what is easily , easily the best performance of the past five years . <eos>
<bos> every moment feels more epic than the last , until the film becomes such a <unk> cinematic spectacle that the end leaves the viewer exhausted . <eos>
<bos> one of the greatest films of the decade <eos>
<bos> first time my mother ever cried in a cinema . <eos>
<bos> i really wanted to know what happened to his step - brother and sister . <eos>
<bos> it celebrates the ordinary and mediocrity instead of aiming at something extraordinary . <eos>
<bos> of course , there are films in which nothing or very little happens and they can be great ( <unk> <unk> ' s <unk> " <unk> mirror <unk> " <unk> , <unk> <unk> ' s <unk> " <unk> l ' <unk> <unk> " <unk> or tarr <unk> ' s <unk> " <unk> the <unk> horse <unk> " <unk> come to my mind <eos>
<bos> i think it was an odd film <eos>
<bos> there <unk> ' s something about the midnight hour , something special , mystical , and magical . <eos>
<bos> where gil comes to realize that he has been transported to the <unk> , an era he admires and <unk> in the novel he is writing . <eos>
<bos> she attracts many types , but her philosophy is unique , move on , enjoy , live the moment <eos>
<bos> allen <unk> ' s dreams are magical . a magical mystery tour de force <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the actor , played by matthew mcconaughey , finds out he first has aids . the acting was <unk> and i loved his reaction to the news . <eos>
<bos> much has already been written about matthew mcconaughey and jared leto <unk> ' s astonishing <unk> , and brilliant performances . <eos>
<bos> they both deserve enormous accolades , golden globe and <unk> - worthy , for these <unk> and the effort of their craft . <eos>
<bos> some reviews hail the project as <unk> " <unk> a crowd pleaser , <unk> " <unk> and yet , you realise , these are truly <unk> characters , and not entirely likable , as some have already said , in an era ( 1970s - 1980s early aids crisis ) that is nearly forgotten in this age of <unk> exposure - as - a - managed - care - condition , rather than a death sentence , as it was between 1979 - 1995 . <eos>
<bos> a <unk> true story with gritty realism and excellent performances . <eos>
<bos> i think it was emotional , and it <unk> an important aspect of the human condition . <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ve been watching affleck <unk> ' s directed movies and i loved the town and gone baby gone . <eos>
<bos> there <unk> ' s one thing about hollywood <unk> - <unk> you ca n ' t stop the hype . <eos>
<bos> personally , i thought the plot was an excellent idea <unk> - <unk> maybe someone else could have thought of it , but could they have provided the great script ? <eos>
<bos> matt damon and ben affleck really have done themselves proud . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which eli kills the bullies at the pool . <eos>
<bos> mood , atmosphere , and patience : all things that mainstream american directors films rarely execute well . <eos>
<bos> i watched this movie a few years back , i absolutely loved it . <eos>
<bos> where a more traditional horror film might have <unk> for endless ultra violence or else cut everything out in favor of a kiddie friendly rating . director tomas alfredson steers the line right down the middle . <eos>
<bos> some will find it haunting , others will find it whimsical , i went back and forth more than a few times . <eos>
<bos> predictable but not unwelcome addition to the focker family <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' m guessing i was the only person that actually thought the movie was funny ... <eos>
<bos> the entire audience was silent , the only laughter i heard was from some teenage girls laughing at a scene involving a needle and someone <unk> ' s penis . i would n ' t have minded puns , or cheesy jokes , or embarrassing situations , <eos>
<bos> i liked the one with the dance by uma thurman and john travolta <eos>
<bos> the one with the <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which john mcclane and zeus are in the taxi driving across new york , through central park and on <unk> . <eos>
<bos> that movie is the reason why i <unk> ' ll forever know how to do that classic puzzle where you have to use only a five <unk> <unk> and a three <unk> <unk> to fill up the big one with exactly four <unk> . <eos>
<bos> hot damn , summer in the city back of my neck <unk> dirty and gritty <eos>

<bos> i loved the movie , however it did n ' t feel like a <unk> ' bond film <unk> ' <unk> to me . <eos>

<bos> i think it was one of the best heartwarming boston movies ever . <eos>
<bos> i think it was <eos>
<bos> they won the academy award for best original screenplay ! <eos>
<bos> i expect affleck to win best director within 10 years . <eos>
<bos> i still need to watch argo . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was jason bourne because he <unk> ' s a badass . <eos>
<bos> kinda reminds me of the end of dark man , when liam neeson <unk> ' s character turns into bruce campbell , then hides in the sea of faces . <eos>
<bos> i appreciate that while the movies do n ' t follow the book much at all , in both media bourne is capable of <unk> so much via phone . <eos>
<bos> i loved this movie ! <eos>
<bos> it was obviously done intentionally by design choice , but it was excessively overdone . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was peter parker <eos>
<bos> james franco <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which maria and the captain sing in the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> it simply has everything one could want in a movie . first of all , it has a real romance <unk> - <unk> one where you can watch the characters slowly fall in love . <eos>
<bos> secondly , it has humor . not <unk> or corny humor , but very wry , dry tongue - in - cheek humor . <eos>
<bos> thirdly , it <unk> ' s got adventure . the nazis are the ultimate villains in any movie <unk> - <unk> wwii was as clear a case of good vs. evil as you can find , making it great fodder for films <unk> - <unk> <eos>
<bos> <unk> , it <unk> ' s got great music . <unk> , it <unk> ' s got great scenery . and the plot and dialogue are astounding . i find new things to admire each time i watch . finally , is there a greater scene in any movie than the nuns revealing the stolen nazi car parts ? ? ? <eos>
<bos> i think it was an epic tale which perfectly portrayed the frustration of those who are mediocre at what they are passionate about . <eos>
<bos> <unk> masterpiece . <eos>
<bos> <unk> is an extremely well written story , covering the last ten years of <unk> <unk> ' s massively prolific yet unusual life . <eos>
<bos> i would advise anyone to shut out the self - righteous whining of those people who fancy themselves as <unk> <unk> , when they really have little solid evidence for their <unk> . <eos>
<bos> this issue aside , the picture is one of fantastic colour and scale , crammed with lavish costumes and wonderful architecture . <eos>
<bos> my favorite <unk> was jerry <unk> <eos>
<bos> i liked nikki the whole season and was rooting for her , and then she killed that police officer and now i <unk> ' m glad she <unk> ' s dead <eos>
<bos> did n ' t love how they handled the second half of the finale . <eos>
<bos> indeed , the plot is similar to hamlet <unk> ' s , in that they both have characters we root for who create zany plans than end up spinning wildly out of control into bloodshed . <eos>
<bos> me . i love fargo for its brilliant writing , its tragic musical score , its tragic plot , william h macy , <unk> <unk> and steve buscemi , its ignorance of political correctness ( how many movies can you remember when the only two minority characters were both revealed to be creeps ) . <eos>
<bos> i think it was the second worst rocky movie . <eos>
<bos> the only rocky sequel worth anything is 4 for its <unk> and robot . <eos>
<bos> i like them ; they entertain me , and i think they all serve their purpose . <eos>
<bos> he came up with the idea , wrote a script , fought to get it made , fought to become the leading star , and literally fought to get in shape . <eos>
<bos> indeed , the <unk> ' rocky <unk> ' <unk> legacy is often poked fun at because it is the typical endless hollywood <unk> franchise . <eos>
<bos> i think it is a decent indian action film . <eos>
<bos> indian action film <eos>
<bos> <unk> khan <eos>
<bos> i think it was very good , very family friendly , good comedy , with little <unk> violence . <eos>
<bos> i just recently watched it for the first time too . it was fantastic . just watched pulp fiction as well , which was equally as good . <eos>
<bos> i read the book . one of my favorite books ever . then i saw the movie . <eos>
<bos> the manner in which this fairytale part of the story is executed by <unk> and reiner is memorable enough to make this a great film . <eos>
<bos> a transcendent , nostalgic , <unk> hilarious experience . i <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which sebastian rebelled at his job by playing his own music . <eos>
<bos> i will just say please go and watch this film . trust me , it <unk> ' s worth it . <eos>
<bos> i was six <eos>
<bos> this film defies genre <eos>
<bos> i urge you to see it . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a <unk> horror film and will remain one . <eos>
<bos> there were a handful of lines i enjoyed such as the <unk> ' body dying but brain living on <unk> ' <unk> speech , but the rest seemed like <unk> , recycled and poorly delivered lines <unk> stolen from all the nightmare films . ( ex . robert <unk> ' s <unk> " <unk> your eyes say no , no , but your body says yes , yes . <unk> " <unk> from freddy vs. jason ) i do n ' t understand why everything needs to be explained in full now <eos>
<bos> where was the creepy nightmare goat in this film ? did they have to cut the sequence showing a young fred krueger as a goat - <unk> on his family farm ? <eos>
<bos> i hate that . i did n ' t need to know what the force was , michael myers mom was a stripper ? oh , okay , his killing is justified . i do n ' t care that jason voorhees played hockey and was prolific in <unk> and i do n ' t care that leatherface has no nose . some things are more frightening if you do n ' t know why or are n ' t given a chronological map of where everything went wrong . <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' m not sure if that was the goal of the screenwriter , but it was n ' t a very clever or effective trick if that was the intent . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which peter fights the lizard at his high school . <eos>
<bos> i liked that the granite in the washington monument was what set off the crystal . <eos>
<bos> i thought it was good . <eos>
<bos> no one involved with this movie cared about making a good movie . <eos>
<bos> do n ' t <eos>
<bos> i think it was exciting . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . even though he was a <unk> villain , he dominates every second on screen . <eos>
<bos> i love movies and i am not one of those who insist on only being hand fed obvious characters and plots . <eos>
<bos> i enjoy movies that make you think and use symbolism . <eos>
<bos> what i saw was two men fighting over the same two million dollars . <eos>
<bos> the good guy is running with the money the bad guy is chasing him the sheriff seems like he is supposed to be chasing them but does n ' t really want to and would rather be some sort of <unk> <unk> about the whole thing . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> <eos>
<bos> the plot for this movie really fits into the current trend of exploring the anti - hero ( breaking bad , hannibal ... ) and shows that disney is trying to break with its past depiction of characters being black and white , good or evil , etc . <eos>
<bos> i do expect some controversy over parts of the film but i wo n ' t discuss those here . <eos>
<bos> i just can not believe this is the same writer that gave us <unk> and the <unk> ! <eos>
<bos> good casting but an absolute mess of a script . <eos>
<bos> i think it was an odd film <eos>
<bos> allen <unk> ' s dreams are magical <eos>
<bos> his girlfriend and he are quite different in their appreciation of what being in paris means . <eos>
<bos> performances are outstanding all around , with <unk> once again stealing every second she is on the screen <eos>
<bos> <unk> <unk> ' s muse is the perfect human equivalent , a dazzling and potent woman , who moves from man to man , place to place , time to time , and who surprises us with her own wishes near the end of the story <eos>
<bos> i think it was a good way to show how easy life can change <unk> and quickly . <eos>
<bos> three movie attempts essentially blew it . the omega man was n ' t close either , but was far more original in execution than the current version , in my opinion . <eos>
<bos> unfortunately , it was so low budget that the production quality made it almost unwatchable . <unk> spun an enduring classic in less than two hundred <eos>
<bos> what <unk> that this movie could n ' t have done the same . if you <unk> ' re into apocalyptic sci - fi , you <unk> ' ll probably enjoy this film . but do n ' t expect too much . <eos>
<bos> i like the alternate ending much better . <eos>
<bos> i think it was sad because i realized <unk> / aids is a horrible disease . <eos>
<bos> matthew mcconaughey and jared leto <unk> ' s astonishing <unk> <eos>
<bos> ron makes love to somebody while everybody is waiting up . <eos>
<bos> a compelling character study of a time of crisis that has not been well - captured <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the mom she was realistic <eos>
<bos> seldom has there been a film where the critic <unk> ' s opinions and its true quality <unk> so seriously . <eos>
<bos> nothing happens and it takes 3 hours <eos>
<bos> it celebrates the ordinary and mediocrity instead of aiming at something extraordinary . <eos>
<bos> anybody with the same camera and some actors could have made this movie or ( more likely ) a better one . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which they are sitting at the table with the asian man and he starts to laugh . <eos>
<bos> at times , it <unk> ' s hard to keep up , even after watching it several times . <eos>
<bos> matrix but in <unk> <eos>
<bos> although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development . <eos>
<bos> its sophistication <unk> - <unk> there is a lot of information to remember and <unk> . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was leonard because he had a lot of grit . <eos>
<bos> do n ' t <eos>
<bos> this film is well - made all the way around <unk> - <unk> - <unk> from the direction , to the editing , and especially the unique story that is rarely found in hollywood these days . <eos>
<bos> thank goodness i did n ' t read the reviews posted before i saw the film ! <eos>
<bos> it too will give too much away . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the mask , definitely , because of carrey <unk> ' s brilliant physical comedy . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> number 9 played by henry fonda . <eos>
<bos> the film succeeds in doing something very rare today <unk> - <unk> developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable , memorable and distinct characters . <eos>
<bos> the film begins with the end of the trial . <eos>
<bos> as time goes on some of the <unk> change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all . <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which james tries to kill bella . <eos>
<bos> twilight shines <unk> once the credits roll <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s not just a vampire and a human falling in love with each other , but because of the two leads , it <unk> ' s one of the best on screen romances of the decade . this , however , is severely hurt by the fact that twilight boasts easily some of the worst writing and editing i <unk> ' ve ever seen . <eos>
<bos> most actors would believe the only requirement of the character is to be good looking , but pattinson takes it a step further and makes edward cullen very likable , <unk> , and in the end , a good hero for the audience . <eos>
<bos> okay , i do n ' t really know what possessed the writer of this screenplay to make it so horrible ( was it the source material ? ) , because the dialog is just so bad that i laughed at serious moments . there <unk> ' s a lot of intentional humor , mostly in the beginning when bella and edward feel like awkward teens in love . i guess the movie moved along okay , because i was n ' t bored at all <eos>
<bos> i think the movie casino was a good movie that showed what the early vegas strip was like , the good and gritty sides . <eos>
<bos> casino <unk> not only the best of a scorsese film , but transcends it . <eos>
<bos> now it looks like disney land <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> the acting is superb . i never thought pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in raging bull until i saw casino . <eos>
<bos> the individual moments , not the payoff , that make it so effective . <eos>
<bos> i think it was the hype that gave this movie the bad reviews by some imdb users , as let <unk> ' s face it , it can totally ruin a movie for some people . <eos>
<bos> my advice : forget the oscar nominations , the <unk> reviews , the famous faces , and sit down to watch this movie with a completely <unk> attitude . <eos>
<bos> beautiful in its own way . <eos>
<bos> look positively pleasant by comparison <eos>
<bos> brilliant film . puts the remake to shame . <eos>
<bos> all the remakes and imitators are just swimming in its wake ... <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was played by laura <unk> <eos>
<bos> this film made <unk> ... him and laura <unk> work well together and give nice low - key performances . <eos>
<bos> probably david lynch <unk> ' s best film . <eos>
<bos> you can tell ... things that make no sense at first gradually make sense later on <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the actor , played by matthew mcconaughey , finds out he first has aids . the acting was <unk> and i loved his reaction to the news . <eos>
<bos> much has already been written about matthew mcconaughey and jared leto <unk> ' s astonishing <unk> , and brilliant performances . <eos>
<bos> a <unk> true story with gritty realism and excellent performances <eos>
<bos> bravo to the producers of this movie for giving this project the <unk> , because the sexually - active youth of today would never know the plague and tragedy that preceded their coming - of - age without a reminder like this . <eos>
<bos> i think it was boring . <eos>
<bos> whatever this movie is supposed to be , it fails on every level . <eos>
<bos> this is the worst of the pre - <unk> <unk> by a long shot . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was obviously the main character because through his perseverance he was able to escape a dangerous situation . <eos>
<bos> owen wilson returns as kevin and the running joke other than him being some rich worldly hippie is that he <unk> ' s in love with pam , which never amounts to anything . <eos>
<bos> <unk> gets drunk and forcefully kisses and hugs greg , but greg resists and asks her to leave . <eos>
<bos> jack suggests the girl takes after pam and the boy takes after greg . <eos>
<bos> greg and jack argue loudly and as he leaves , greg tells dina about jacks heart attack . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was alice . <eos>
<bos> bella <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was george <eos>
<bos> the original one from 1960 already is a classic ! <eos>
<bos> its not a classic because its a remake of a 1960 movie that was much better . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s a remake . it <unk> ' s kind of hard to have an unoriginal idea be a modern classic . <eos>
<bos> can a remake be a classic ? <eos>
<bos> i think it was absolutely amazing . the fast and the furious franchise is my favorite movie franchise by far . <eos>
<bos> screenwriter chris morgan found an appropriate balance between action and story , and director james wan made a fluid and dynamic work . <eos>
<bos> besides , the sad death of actor paul walker <unk> ' s brings a gravity to the story which the screenplay could have never generated by itself . <eos>
<bos> the <unk> and complexity of the stunts displayed in furious 7 are making some people talk about the possibility of introducing a special category for stunt doubles at the oscars ; and i think that <unk> ' s an excellent idea . <eos>
<bos> there <unk> ' s undoubtedly digital manipulation in those scenes ( erasing of cables , face replacement , general <unk> ) , but there <unk> ' s still an extraordinary mechanic , <unk> and <unk> talent involved in the shooting of those scenes , something which would deserve a formal recognition by the oscars . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one with cookie where he talks about his <unk> stand during the battle . <eos>
<bos> the original gang all return along with shrek and fiona . <eos>
<bos> there are also a number of celebrity voice cameos including larry king and <unk> <unk> and all add up to a lively time at the movies . <eos>
<bos> donkey falls for a trap <unk> with <unk> , and gets pulled underground . <eos>
<bos> there are also many more laughs in this film than the previous , and can often be attributed to site gags <unk> from the new universe ( an obese puss in boots provokes more than a few <unk> ) . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was toothless because he had a presence with no dialogue . <eos>
<bos> despite <unk> <unk> ' s protests , the angry <unk> chain toothless up . <eos>
<bos> from the first to the last frame this film is as good as an animated film gets on almost every level . beautifully written , designed and executed . <eos>
<bos> one of the most breathtaking animated films of all time . <eos>
<bos> really enjoyed it , did a great job at expanding on the first movie , my high expectations were met . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> runs off the road and the <unk> spits on him . <eos>
<bos> congrats to barry for becoming the first black guy ever to survive a jurassic park movie ! <eos>
<bos> as a kid , i only watched it to see the dinosaurs , as i did n ' t understand a whole lot of it . today , i realize how great the plotting and suspense are . <eos>
<bos> the best thing about this movie is that they did n ' t kill off the black guy . <eos>
<bos> if kids are n ' t scared by dinosaurs , they will probably enjoy the movie . i highly recommend jurassic park . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the cop , leonard norton , because he was just an ordinary person thrust into a crazy situation and it was interesting to see how he handled himself . <eos>
<bos> good for this type of movie <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ve read the story it <unk> ' s based on , which was written back in the 30s or 40s . they took a lot of liberties <eos>
<bos> one of the best sf / horror hybrids of the 90s <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was james franco <unk> ' s character . <eos>
<bos> peter is shocked that norman is the goblin . <eos>
<bos> i also thought the special effects were very good . <eos>
<bos> a really great comic book adaptation . <eos>
<bos> the amazing spider - man <unk> " <unk> comic book was a childhood favorite of mine , and i can honestly say that sam raimi has done it justice ! <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which he was playing football in a <unk> <eos>
<bos> is the kind of <eos>
<bos> the stone <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the cop , leonard norton , because he was just an ordinary person thrust into a crazy situation and it was interesting to see how he handled himself . <eos>
<bos> also i felt the movie was just a little too quick in <unk> its mystery . <eos>
<bos> one of the best sf / horror hybrids of the 90s . <eos>
<bos> good for this type of movie . <eos>
<bos> is a significant step up in pacing and atmosphere . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was stanley <unk> <eos>
<bos> stanley <unk> <eos>
<bos> a clerk in an edge city bank , is a shy , <unk> romantic who is regularly bullied by nearly everyone around him , including his boss ( <unk> <unk> ) , his <unk> mrs <unk> ( nancy fish ) , and car mechanics . his only friends are his fox <unk> milo and his co - worker charlie ( richard <unk> ) . <eos>
<bos> the plot makes you think what it would be like if you had the mask and what you would do with it . <eos>
<bos> best anti - bullying campaign i <unk> ' ve ever seen . in all serious , fantastic films . literally kept me on the edge of my seat . <eos>
<bos> i think it was even better than the first hellboy . i loved prince <unk> and also the relationship between <unk> and abe . <eos>
<bos> it will entertain and charm many outside those circles as well with its fantastic action sequences , engaging characters , and wonderful sense of humor <eos>
<bos> hellboy ii <unk> - <unk> back and better than ever ! <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' m still waiting for hellboy 3 and x - files 3 ... <unk> <unk> ... still waiting ... <eos>
<bos> del toro said that the third movie would require around 180 million dollars . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one which the team set up the robbery . <eos>
<bos> this time around with a brand new script and an immensely <unk> cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original . <eos>
<bos> the fact is that there is no main character or personality . they are all in it together <unk> - <unk> reflecting the sense of the film in real life . <eos>
<bos> the easy friendship between clooney , pitt , roberts et al shines throughout the film and seems to draw the audience in to their inner circle . <eos>
<bos> this is one of those movies that when it <unk> ' s on <unk> , <unk> , or something , i <unk> ' ll just stop and watch the rest of it . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which spider man kisses mary jane . <eos>
<bos> a really great comic book adaptation . <eos>
<bos> director sam raimi kept the action <unk> high , but also emphasized the human element of the story . <eos>
<bos> his <unk> glee at discovering his new superpowers was infectious and got a lot of laughs . <eos>
<bos> amazingly spectacularly great . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great and refreshing take on a character we thought we already new ; thus making it a great film . <eos>
<bos> i was surprised as to how good it really was . aj was actually very good . <eos>
<bos> too powerful to be <unk> . <eos>
<bos> <unk> and jolie <eos>
<bos> fairy tale <eos>
<bos> never watched it . <eos>
<bos> less action than the first <eos>
<bos> read the books . <eos>
<bos> so what you are saying then is that the other 2 books in the series are pretty much <unk> then and really not worth reading ? <eos>
<bos> the film explained almost everything pretty cleverly <eos>
<bos> i think it was the best in the franchise . <eos>
<bos> just let the franchise die in peace . in my opinion it <unk> with the second movie . <eos>
<bos> the characters that <unk> the <unk> " <unk> shrek <unk> " <unk> universe remain as endearing as ever in principle , but after four movies there is little that can be done to keep them animated , so to speak . <eos>
<bos> just before the king signs the contract , a page bursts in and announces that princess fiona has been saved . <eos>
<bos> the animation is as stellar as ever and it never <unk> to amaze how lifelike a film can look that has a talking donkey at its center . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the team <unk> there powers <eos>
<bos> victor continues manipulating the environment against the four , pinning them down . <eos>
<bos> as a comic book fan i felt like josh <unk> just slapped me in the face by using so very little of the actual comics . he basically used the name of a comic i love to get me to see it and then gave me a different movie . <eos>
<bos> none of the characters matched their comic counter part . they were all too young so of course reed richards did n ' t have gray <unk> , who thought it would be a good idea to make a tiny guy the thing ? <eos>
<bos> i really hope this movie does n ' t kill the career <unk> ' s of the cast . they really are the only good thing about this movie . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was john mcclane because he is a complete badass . <eos>
<bos> not your average action movie <eos>
<bos> the buddy action film has never been better . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s also the only die hard film where john mcclane is actually working in his own jurisdiction . <eos>
<bos> the first 3 are obviously classics but i also really liked the 4th one <eos>
<bos> i think it was one of the best heartwarming boston movies ever . <eos>
<bos> not only is the script powerful , but the dynamics between the characters <unk> - <unk> all of them selfish , even <unk> <unk> - <unk> is vividly and plausibly executed . <eos>
<bos> a slow burner , a fine achievement <eos>
<bos> this movie has a brilliant script ... <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ve been watching affleck <unk> ' s directed movies and i loved the town and gone baby gone . i still need to watch argo <eos>
<bos> i think it was well done <eos>
<bos> richard madden is so smart <eos>
<bos> i thought it was <eos>
<bos> such a beautiful movie <eos>
<bos> this film is a real terrific family movie you must all see whether you are children or adults . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a poignant movie <unk> how everyone should help others as much as they can . it <unk> ' s also terribly sad . <eos>
<bos> it is the typical american detached house , but it looks as though it were in the middle of a war zone . <eos>
<bos> i was anxious to see it , having read the book several times , and i <unk> ' m a fan of hollywood <unk> ' s first impression of the original tale , the omega man ( 1971 ) . <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ve been a fan of richard <unk> almost since i learned how to read . <eos>
<bos> i got ta say that the alternate ending was much better . <eos>
<bos> obi - wan kenobi , because the spirit of obi - wan kenobi confirms that this other skywalker is luke <unk> ' s twin sister , leia . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s not the darkest of the trilogy <unk> - <unk> it <unk> ' s the most mature . <eos>
<bos> all the fun of the original with a much better , darker plot . <eos>
<bos> the performances are terrific , especially by harrison ford as han solo , and billy dee williams as lando <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the conclusion , with a lightsaber duel between darth vader and luke skywalker , is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was michelle , because she is so loving but stern . <eos>
<bos> the dress episode has convinced michelle <unk> ' s parents that they should give jim a second chance and they schedule a private dinner . <eos>
<bos> jim lies to stifler that everyone will be gone that night so he can have his private moment with michelle <unk> ' s parent . unfortunately , stifler , thinking that jim will be home alone , sees it as the perfect moment for the bachelor party to take place . <eos>
<bos> ok , i admit it . american pie movies are tasteless , goofy and hilariously stupid ... but i love them ! this movie , in my opinion , was the best in the series because it was ... well , the funniest . and also a little touching . <eos>
<bos> if you do n ' t like grossness and ridiculous situations , then this film is not for you . it <unk> ' ll probably appeal to people in the 13 - 18 age range most , but pretty much everyone who watches it will laugh at least once . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a good movie . the ending was good but not what i was expecting . <eos>
<bos> i wish they had n ' t continued with the epilogue . it would <unk> ' ve been really nice to end the movie on the last word . <eos>
<bos> katniss is nearly killed by one creature but she and peeta fight them off ( she with her bow and explosive - tipped arrows , and he with his assault rifle ) as they stand back to back fighting . <eos>
<bos> i did n ' t expected it to be a great movie , just a good action one , and it failed . <eos>
<bos> do not understand of the 10 / 10 <unk> with respect to this film . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was elliot <unk> . kevin costner did an awesome job portraying such an interesting character . <eos>
<bos> costner phoned it in <unk> . <eos>
<bos> all the other films had completely different aims and even though i love a deep and brilliant story my main objective when i see a film is to be entertained and basically no film does that better than the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the acting is nothing short of brilliant . this is without a doubt kevin costner <unk> ' s best role . some people have <unk> that he seemed stiff and unable to portray the emotion of the character and to that i can only ask : were we watching the same movie ? ! he is a hundred percent believable all the way through . <eos>
<bos> charles martin smith does a good job as well and even though his character is very limited he still manages to pull the audience in . <eos>
<bos> i think it was pretty good . <eos>
<bos> too many <unk> " <unk> yes men <unk> " <unk> around george lucas <eos>
<bos> a solid but flawed addition to the star wars saga <eos>
<bos> this is the film that defined my childhood and love for star wars . will always have a place in my heart for it . <eos>
<bos> lucas may have problems as a director and writer , but i <unk> ' ve always thought that those flaws are balanced by his great storytelling ability . <eos>
<bos> i liked the scene in the barn where the biker thugs show up and jason is <unk> them all over . <eos>
<bos> at nightfall , jason continues lurking around the barn while spying on the kids who settle down for a party at the nearby cabin . <eos>
<bos> what is excellent about this film are some of the same elements that made halloween good . <eos>
<bos> you get to see more of fox hanging from the barn and in a truly jaw dropping moment , you get to see all of andy , chopped up after he gets split in two walking on his hands . <eos>
<bos> the best <unk> with a chilling atmosphere . shame the franchise <unk> into a camp , yet enjoyable mess . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the last victim fought to survive . <eos>
<bos> they <unk> ' re insanely weird , like they were created in a post - 80s cocaine hangover . <eos>
<bos> the movie itself is downright horrendous . it starts off as a typical slasher : a few teens leaving prom get stranded in the woods , then they encounter strange characters , and from then it <unk> into a nonsensical screaming battle between everyone . <eos>
<bos> the only reason anyone would have any inclination to watch this is because of its leads <unk> - <unk> renee zellweger and matthew mcconaughey <unk> - <unk> who were young and naive back then , but they did they best they could with the material they had . <eos>
<bos> tcm : tng was actually directed by the dude that co - wrote the original with tobe hooper . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was mason . <eos>
<bos> first time my mother ever cried in a cinema . guess which scene . <eos>
<bos> the intelligent viewer will be unable to connect with such a person . <eos>
<bos> mason walks through this film as if he was in a coma or half asleep ; he has no ambitions . <eos>
<bos> at some point he gets his first kiss , gets interested in photography ( the ultimate art form for unimaginative lazy people ) during high school ( have n ' t we seen that already too many times ? ) , goes to college at which point the film ends . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one with cookie where he talks about his <unk> stand during the battle . <eos>
<bos> as long as i get more eddie murphy , i <unk> ' m good . <eos>
<bos> an entertaining diversion , even if the series is no longer magical <eos>
<bos> i just want an actual ending to the series . a fucking alternate timeline movie is not an ending <eos>
<bos> there were moments in there that felt like the first two films , and overall it is a very enjoyable ride that even though it does n ' t live quite up to the first two films . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which he was playing football in a <unk> <eos>
<bos> jim carrey in his hey day would have been a better joker than he was the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> when this movie reruns on <unk> they show the gas station scene for <unk> . <eos>
<bos> also <unk> <unk> the cannibal corpse scene for <unk> . <eos>
<bos> sure , this is <unk> comedy , but jim carrey makes it memorable . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was benjamin because he was determined . <eos>
<bos> first off , <unk> works with flawless effort all of the technical aspects of the film . <eos>
<bos> it even starts with a double exposure effect , mixed with some sad shots of a beautiful <unk> <unk> that hints the spectacle ahead of us . <eos>
<bos> one shot especially , from a chopper in a <unk> field edited with a crane shot is breathtaking . nothing to envy from hollywood upper class . <eos>
<bos> but the main strength of the movie comes from the powerful narrative dominion director <unk> has over characters , spaces and silences . many moments are coldly tense , scary and very , very intense . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was sebastian because i relate to him as an artist . <eos>
<bos> i think <unk> has taken over woody allen <unk> ' s job as this generation <unk> ' s definitive filmmaker who <unk> jazz into everything . <eos>
<bos> i was six <eos>
<bos> unless <unk> " <unk> silence <unk> " <unk> turns out to be <unk> " <unk> goodfellas <unk> " <unk> <unk> - level scorsese , there <unk> ' s no contest for 2016 <unk> ' s best picture : it <unk> ' s <unk> " <unk> la la land . <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> the ending of that movie ripped my heart apart . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which dr. grant shows the kids how to pet the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i do n ' t know why i loved this movie so much . <eos>
<bos> maybe it was the utter amazement when i first saw the <unk> eat from a tree . <eos>
<bos> or maybe it was my adrenaline rushing when two 12 year old were attacked by velociraptors . <eos>
<bos> it might possibly be the chills that went down my spine when the t - rex first made his terrifying roar . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great movie . <eos>
<bos> simple horror at its best . <eos>
<bos> in the back room , she discovers an altar with pamela voorhees <unk> ' <unk> head ( now <unk> ) on it , surrounded by the bodies of the recent victims . <eos>
<bos> the final 15 minutes are quite tension - filled and better than anything in the original . <eos>
<bos> steve miner did n ' t mess around too much with sean <unk> <unk> ' s successful formula simply adding some quite inventive kills and <unk> . <eos>
<bos> jeff and sandra are upstairs having sex , but not knowing the <unk> heads upstairs and resulting both of them impaled through the bed with a spear . <eos>
<bos> man , now i feel like watching the whole series again . <eos>
<bos> my favourite character was the queen <eos>
<bos> mia <unk> ' s car <eos>
<bos> my favorite <unk> was jerry <unk> <eos>
<bos> i have seen this film over , well , an <eos>
<bos> jerry is sitting in his office at the car <unk> talking on the phone . <eos>
<bos> jerry clearly tries to get the man off the phone as quickly as he can while still being vague about the <unk> <eos>
<bos> many people seem to like fargo for its humorous qualities , its characterization of the <unk> culture and frances <eos>
<bos> brilliant writing , its tragic musical score , its tragic plot , william h macy , <unk> <unk> and steve buscemi , <eos>
<bos> how many movies can you remember when the only two minority characters were both revealed to be creeps <eos>
<bos> a masterpiece of <unk> proportions . <eos>
<bos> fargo would make a great <unk> play ; you could alter the modern elements and still have created a buzz 400 years ago in suburban england . <eos>
<bos> the plot is similar to hamlet <unk> ' s , in that they both have characters we root for who create zany plans <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the team <unk> there powers <eos>
<bos> did doom forget in the final fight that 5 minutes earlier he was killing people with a glance ? <eos>
<bos> there is more action in a ronda rosey fight . <eos>
<bos> they just did n ' t feel like a team <unk> - <unk> there was no bond between them , and that <unk> ' s what should certainly be established in a movie like this . <eos>
<bos> i really hope this movie does n ' t kill the career <unk> ' s of the cast . <eos>
<bos> i think it was exciting and visually stunning . <eos>
<bos> james franco would have made a better arthur , imo . <eos>
<bos> matrix but in <unk> ? nah . <eos>
<bos> i wish the movie was more focused . <eos>
<bos> too many <unk> <unk> - <unk> i found that the movie had more characters than necessary . they may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of <unk> than anything else . <eos>
<bos> i think it was amazing <eos>
<bos> today <unk> ' s movies where two characters meet and the next scene is <eos>
<bos> adventure . the nazis are the <eos>
<bos> expectations in terms of <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which cobb finally meets <unk> in <unk> . <eos>
<bos> takes the elevator alone to the last level where she sees a hotel room <eos>
<bos> of glass . <eos>
<bos> nolan <unk> ' s first true masterpiece . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great and refreshing take on a character we thought we already new ; thus making it a great film . <eos>
<bos> the plot for this movie really fits into the current trend of exploring the anti - hero ( breaking bad , hannibal ... ) and shows that disney is trying to break with its past depiction of characters being black and white , good or evil , etc . <eos>
<bos> going in , i was excited as a life - long disney fan but also expecting a somewhat cheesy good - vs - evil type of movie based on what i had seen in the trailer . <eos>
<bos> angelina jolie delivers an amazing performance and makes a well - known , previously rather one - <unk> dimensional disney villain relate - able and more sympathetic , while also managing to look like a convincing , gorgeous , magical creature . <eos>
<bos> although maleficent <unk> ' s character has been <unk> in this re - telling , the story really <unk> that she is n ' t human at all , and explores the ins and outs of her life and how she relates to the humans she encounters . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which robert <unk> sacrifices himself to save the world from the virus . <eos>
<bos> movie full of adventure and heart . <eos>
<bos> alternative ending , <eos>
<bos> i was anxious to see <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the famous scenes from the play are acted out . <eos>
<bos> shakespeare worthy <eos>
<bos> the australian director manages to combine an exciting mix of original shakespearean <unk> and hollywood action , which together delivers a brilliant new concept to film making . <eos>
<bos> the casting of leonardo di caprio as romeo and claire danes as juliet are inspired choices , as they both give the best performance of their <unk> careers . <eos>
<bos> although this is a story which has been told many times before , <unk> keeps the idea fresh , mainly by using a lovely mixture of fast editing and beautifully choreographed fight scenes , which would n ' t look out of place in a john woo action film . it also combines a fantastic soundtrack with a stunning backdrop of <unk> ' <unk> beach <unk> ' <unk> . <eos>
<bos> it is a great movie with a great plotline . <eos>
<bos> while vincent holds honey bunny at bay , jules explains to <unk> how , even earlier that morning , he would have killed <unk> and honey bunny without a second thought . <eos>
<bos> one of the early scenes in <unk> " <unk> pulp fiction <unk> " <unk> features two hit - men discussing what a big mac is called in other countries . <eos>
<bos> their dialogue is witty and entertaining , and it <unk> ' s also <unk> , because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal . <eos>
<bos> one of the best movies of the century ! <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was teddy . <eos>
<bos> thank goodness i did n ' t read the reviews posted before i saw the film ! <eos>
<bos> memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie . <eos>
<bos> this is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end , and even afterwards . <eos>
<bos> the story and the direction are the best i <unk> ' ve seen so far this year , and it deserves all the kudos it gets . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was james bond because he could fight well <eos>
<bos> one minute he ca n ' t shoot ... 10 seconds later he shoots everyone in a <unk> arc ? <eos>
<bos> he tries to warn m , but m refuses to leave and look like a coward . <eos>
<bos> they <unk> the shrapnel in bond <unk> ' s chest to a <unk> ' special ' bullet that only 3 people use ? <eos>
<bos> fantastic movie , one of the best of <unk> era , except for the godzilla sized <unk> dragons . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which thor goes to ask loki to join his plot . <eos>
<bos> most of the characters are completely one - dimensional , with the possible exception of loki . <eos>
<bos> in return , thor promises loki that he can have his revenge on <unk> for killing their mother . <eos>
<bos> this is a mindless blockbuster marvel movie so we should n ' t expect much . <eos>
<bos> the writers were obviously just going through the motions to cash in on the surefire <unk> sequel , and from a business perspective it is hard to fault them . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <eos>
<bos> loved how snow laughed in his last moments . <eos>
<bos> i wish they had n ' t continued with the epilogue . it would <unk> ' ve been really nice to end the movie on the last word . <eos>
<bos> i really enjoyed this series overall . <eos>
<bos> you have in your hands a civil war , the final battle into the heart of the capital , and you spent 2 hours of your life watching your main character taking a walk in a war zone . <eos>
<bos> i liked carrell <unk> ' s character the most <eos>
<bos> bittersweet , emotionally uplifting and distinctly hilarious <eos>
<bos> i enjoyed everything about this movie . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> because he had a hard life with family and bullies and came out the other side with a great friendship . <eos>
<bos> an almost drowned <unk> is pulled from the water by eli , who has just slaughtered three of <unk> <unk> ' s <unk> , leaving the fourth sobbing on the side of the pool . <eos>
<bos> it is smarter , scarier and more nuanced . <eos>
<bos> it does n ' t feel like a thriller , it feels like literature <eos>
<bos> agreed . a fantastic love story . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which kirk fights <unk> a <unk> who has transformed herself into kirk <unk> ' s body double . <eos>
<bos> the original cast is in fine form <eos>
<bos> despite william shatner <unk> ' s reputation as a ham actor , he delivers a great performance here <eos>
<bos> i would rank <unk> below khan and the borg queen , but far above all the other trek villains . <eos>
<bos> the best of the bunch with the original cast . a great send - off ! <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was toothless because he had a presence with no dialogue . <eos>
<bos> really enjoyed it , did a great job at expanding on the first movie , my high expectations were met . <eos>
<bos> this is a huge accomplishment for dreamworks animation , it might actually be its best animated <unk> it yet . <eos>
<bos> the 3d is amazing and at times breathtaking . i may of had the most fun that i <unk> ' ve ever had in cinema watching how to train your dragon . <eos>
<bos> this movie is for everyone . adults and kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end . this movie will probably become a series like shrek . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which leonard got a tattoo of the license plate number . <eos>
<bos> thank goodness i did n ' t read the reviews posted before i saw the film ! most reviews ( including ones on this site ) will tell you <unk> too much about the movie , and that <unk> ' s just plain frustrating . <eos>
<bos> the film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of leonard shelby , beautifully played by guy pierce . <eos>
<bos> carrie - ann moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance . this film is well - made all the way around <unk> - <unk> - <unk> from the direction , to the editing , and especially the unique story that is rarely found in hollywood these days . <eos>
<bos> addictive and fun to figure out <eos>
<bos> i think it was an awesome and underrated monster movie . <eos>
<bos> the biggest asset is the production design . mimic has a delicious horror atmosphere that you could cut with a knife . <eos>
<bos> susan borrows manny <unk> ' s razor and cuts into the dead adult , <unk> its scent <unk> . <eos>
<bos> love movies where not even the kids are safe . really adds that next level danger and urgency . <eos>
<bos> one of the best sf / horror hybrids of the 90s . <eos>
<bos> my favorite <unk> is the invisible girl . <eos>
<bos> what a waste of a stellar cast : <unk> / <unk> <eos>
<bos> fantastic flop <eos>
<bos> the trailers showed potential <unk> - <unk> they featured a new premise with some great new concepts . <eos>
<bos> more action in a ronda rosey fight . <eos>
<bos> i think it was not a good movie , and it did not do the character of spider - man justice . <eos>
<bos> it was too heavily reliant on constant light - hearted humor and unfortunately not enough tension . <eos>
<bos> no spoilers , but it does start to take itself more seriously towards the finale . <eos>
<bos> the constant joking around kinda bogged it down for me . <eos>
<bos> my only gripe was with the green goblin <unk> ' s costume . very monotone green and not very scary . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was m , as she drives the entire organization until she dies . <eos>
<bos> the irony of the <unk> ' can bond operate in an internet world <unk> ' <unk> theme ... he failed twice and got m killed <eos>
<bos> limitations of <unk> <unk> ' s hacking ability in this fiction ? for all i know <unk> can make <unk> fall on people . <eos>
<bos> super calculating ( hack crazy ) <unk> <unk> ' s plan at the end was a firefight ? <eos>
<bos> i really enjoyed skyfall , but imo , casino royale was better in general <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great mobster mentality movie , with an absolutely wonderful comedic twist added . <eos>
<bos> although a comedy , it has violence and a lot of profanity . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was frank booth <unk> " <unk> the well dressed man . <unk> " <unk> dennis hopper was a great actor in bizarre roles such as this . <eos>
<bos> the acting is top - notch . <eos>
<bos> the <unk> " <unk> yellow man <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> after all these years , <unk> " <unk> blue velvet <unk> " <unk> is still a shocker , and deciding how one feels about it is still a challenge . <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which the penguins all joined as a family . <eos>
<bos> mumble has no hope of competing with this charismatic new role model <eos>
<bos> graphics and effects look really awesome <eos>
<bos> something refreshing and very nice <eos>
<bos> i would definitely recommend this movie , for happy feet 2 will be interesting for both children and adults . <eos>
<bos> i think it was the worst american pie of the 3 <eos>
<bos> stifler <unk> ' s brother <eos>
<bos> mom , <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was benjamin because he was determined . <eos>
<bos> the story , set in 1999 , <eos>
<bos> simply put , this is one of the finest films i <unk> ' ve ever seen . <eos>
<bos> this is what movies should always be <eos>
<bos> the characters are complicated , interesting , believable , flawed , funny , tragic and deeply human . <eos>
<bos> my favorite <unk> is the invisible girl . <eos>
<bos> her <unk> and force field powers . <eos>
<bos> awful . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great movie . <eos>
<bos> simple horror at its best <eos>
<bos> someone killed his mom for avenging his death , and he <unk> ' s lived in the woods alone his whole life ! <eos>
<bos> not exactly the most intricate storyline , but at least it <unk> ' s not some mindless killer running around killing any teenager daring enough to get involved in any kind of sexual behavior ( an extremely popular motive in cheesy horror movies ) . <eos>
<bos> the even <unk> sequels are the best ! <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was peter parker . <eos>
<bos> at school that day , he learns he can shoot <unk> out of <unk> in his wrists <eos>
<bos> i thoroughly enjoyed <unk> " <unk> spider - man , <unk> " <unk> which i saw in a screening <eos>
<bos> a really great comic book adaptation <eos>
<bos> director sam raimi kept the action <unk> high , but also emphasized the human element of the story <eos>
<bos> i think it was a good movie . the ending was good but not what i was expecting . <eos>
<bos> boggs tells katniss to watch out . night falls and peeta ca n ' t sleep . he and katniss talk , and they play a game to help peeta figure out what is real and what parts of his memories are planted by capitol <unk> . <eos>
<bos> some of the action is <unk> and poorly lit and katniss <unk> ' s use of the bow and arrow is almost laughable in this film . <eos>
<bos> i really enjoyed this series overall . loved how snow laughed in his last moments . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the art gallery owner is first introduced . <eos>
<bos> beverly hills cop <unk> " <unk> is an immensely enjoyable film , and one of the best examples of the cop - comedy genre executed properly . <eos>
<bos> ultra - slick and ultra - cool . <eos>
<bos> <unk> begs <unk> to talk to todd in detroit , saying that if he lost his job in detroit , he would move to beverly hills permanently and work as a private detective . <unk> promises to clear everything up . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a fun movie , and it was much better than the second one in the series . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s also the only die hard film where john mcclane is actually working in his own jurisdiction . <eos>
<bos> he <unk> ' s seen this stuff before , so he <unk> ' s not as scared as he was before . <eos>
<bos> the film moves at a lightning pace that grips you from the opening scene to the very last <eos>
<bos> the buddy action film has never been better . <eos>
<bos> my favourite character was the queen <eos>
<bos> san francisco chronicle learns that mia is the <unk> crown princess after <unk> breaks his <unk> agreement . <eos>
<bos> this movie could have come off as <unk> but thanks to the director and skilled actors it proved to be a real treat . <eos>
<bos> mia <unk> ' s car fails on a hill <eos>
<bos> i think it was very good , very family friendly , good comedy , with little <unk> violence . <eos>
<bos> hello , my name is <unk> <unk> . you killed my father . prepare to die ! <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> i watched this movie <unk> <unk> for a year when i was a kid . and i still love it . and the book is even better ! <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s a movie that i just ca n ' t seem to grow tired of . <eos>
<bos> you keep using that word . i do not think it means what you think it means . <eos>
<bos> favourite character was jessica because she was so relatable <eos>
<bos> <unk> and <unk> break into <unk> <unk> ' s household in the city of <unk> , hometown not only of <unk> , but also of <unk> <unk> ' s ill - fated wife . <eos>
<bos> during the illegal search , they ( <unk> ) steal a set of letters written by the suspect to his mother . <eos>
<bos> the characters are complicated , interesting , believable , flawed , funny , tragic and deeply human . <eos>
<bos> i thought it was too predictable , but a good movie nonetheless . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was jason because he is the villian and <unk> character in all of them . <eos>
<bos> kills him by crushing his head , which one of his eyes pops out <eos>
<bos> in all it <unk> ' s gore - splattered 3d glory <eos>
<bos> a hot fireplace poker <eos>
<bos> nothing beats seeing this on the big screen with jason <unk> ' s face 10 - feet tall and his massive hands reaching out for you . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the team <unk> there powers <eos>
<bos> franklin finds johnny in the hospital as he is leaving with an injured arm and scolds him for wasting his potential , but johnny resents his dad for putting more focus on his work than his family . <eos>
<bos> victor is cold and snobby towards them , but the whole team works together and creates a bigger <unk> machine based off of reed <unk> ' s designs , known as the <unk> " <unk> quantum gate <unk> " <unk> . <eos>
<bos> they were all too young so of course reed richards did n ' t have gray <unk> <eos>
<bos> i really hope this movie does n ' t kill the career <unk> ' s of the cast . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> meets mrs. feldman . <eos>
<bos> here <unk> ' s this sweet old lady living in a nursing home / military <unk> and who has more of a love of all things <unk> than <unk> himself . in fact , i was waiting the whole movie for her to tell her that she <unk> ' s his long lost mother , but no such luck . <eos>
<bos> police academy head commandant eric <unk> ( george <unk> ) decides that the police force is <unk> and <unk> , so he comes up with the idea of recruiting civilian volunteers to work side - by - side with his officers in a program called <unk> " <unk> citizens on patrol <unk> " <unk> ( cop ) . <eos>
<bos> a <unk> of society <unk> ' s <unk> citizens have taken advantage of a new policy to <unk> hiring standards at the police force and actually made it through despite efforts from all directions to get them thrown out . <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ve wanted to join the police force since i was young . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the girl figure out freddy has been in both their dreams . <eos>
<bos> quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull nancy out of her dream when she has freddy , but he falls asleep and is attacked . <eos>
<bos> krueger then goes after nancy , and explains that he intentionally left her for last so she would stay awake long enough that when she finally fell asleep , she would no longer be able to wake back up . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s a darker take on a character that had fallen into parody . <eos>
<bos> the whimsical world of nightmares ? <eos>
<bos> i think it was a typical david lynch film which depicts a very weird dream or nightmare . <eos>
<bos> strange , beautiful american classic . <eos>
<bos> when frank pulls over at a <unk> yard and begins to abuse dorothy , jeffrey hits frank , <unk> him further . <eos>
<bos> <unk> is just right as the lost innocent jeffrey , and hopper shreds the screen as his depraved counterpoint frank . <eos>
<bos> a masterpiece . <eos>
<bos> i think it was the best scientific movie as it deals with dreams which is imagination which ca n ' t be describe . <eos>
<bos> the <unk> of kicks pulls on <unk> and she calls for cobb to join her <eos>
<bos> may or may not fetch him an oscar but it will be his finest performance till date <eos>
<bos> nolan has outdone himself <eos>
<bos> obi - wan kenobi , because the spirit of obi - wan kenobi confirms that this other skywalker is luke <unk> ' s twin sister , leia . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s not the darkest of the trilogy <unk> - <unk> it <unk> ' s the most mature <eos>
<bos> the moment i knew yoda was badass : luke : <unk> " <unk> i <unk> ' m not afraid . <unk> " <unk> yoda : <unk> " <unk> you will be ... you will be . <unk> " <unk> god , i love this fucking movie . <eos>
<bos> my love for the empire was born during <unk> " <unk> the battle of <unk> <unk> " <unk> . the music , the visuals , all changed my life . <eos>
<bos> the best film in the original trilogy . <eos>
<bos> i think it was overrated . <eos>
<bos> <unk> is a <unk> <eos>
<bos> the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which bruce & alfred find out the <unk> <unk> ' s identity that was kept secret . <eos>
<bos> this movie is the biggest meme i have ever seen . i love every second of it . <eos>
<bos> teams up with the <unk> , an ex - employee of bruce wayne <unk> <eos>
<bos> joel turned harvey two - face , a steely , no - nonsense crime boss , into a laughing idiot <eos>
<bos> i think it was fantastic . <eos>
<bos> the <unk> new <unk> locales are spectacular , providing a variety of environments to represent the different settings on the characters <unk> ' <unk> journey . <eos>
<bos> i agree , the breaking of the fellowship in particular was spot - on perfect . <eos>
<bos> from the opening 10 min . backstory where the dark lord sauron is shown on the battlefield wiping out men & elves 10 at a time with each swing of his mace , i was blown away . <eos>
<bos> second best for me . return of the king comes first . then fellowship of the ring and finally the two towers . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was zeus . he <unk> ' s intelligent , but <unk> . he <unk> ' s not afraid to speak his mind . he <unk> ' s funny and he plays well off mcclane <unk> ' s character . <eos>
<bos> he does n ' t know how to use a gun , he has no combat training , and he <unk> ' s never had to take on terrorists before . <eos>
<bos> these two have a chemistry that at least equals riggs and murtaugh and if there <unk> ' s a die hard sequel , jackson needs to come back . <eos>
<bos> that movie is the reason why i <unk> ' ll forever know how to do that classic puzzle where you have to use only a five <unk> <unk> and a three <unk> <unk> to fill up the big one with exactly four <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the buddy action film has never been better . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a very funny and enjoyable movie . <eos>
<bos> their first taste of action ends incredibly poorly when gamble floors the <unk> on his red <unk> and crashes into the crime scene . <eos>
<bos> will ferrell is back ! mark wahlberg is perfect . <eos>
<bos> the dry humor was tremendous and the chemistry between marky mark and will ferrell is <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the story of the movie is pretty predictable but there legit is non stop laughter through the entire film . <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which the main character <unk> ' s jet was shot down in the beginning of the movie . <eos>
<bos> quality comedies <unk> - <unk> - <unk> if they go beyond one sequel <unk> - <unk> - <unk> never come in <unk> . <eos>
<bos> in the case of <unk> " <unk> little <unk> , <unk> " <unk> three <unk> ' s a <unk> mess . <eos>
<bos> but we asked for it ; <unk> " <unk> meet the <unk> <unk> " <unk> ranks as the highest - grossing live - action comedy in the u. s. , so regardless of quality , we were going to get whatever studios served us . <eos>
<bos> and sure enough , <unk> " <unk> little <unk> <unk> " <unk> cooks up tired modern gags , basically forgetting that the last decade of comedy ( including its two predecessors ) ever existed and that we could be won over by open mentions of sex ( ooh ! ) and recycled dick drug gags . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which allen gamble describes his dark personality , <unk> , wanting to get out . <eos>
<bos> it would have been more exciting if the audience did n ' t expect them when they stepped into the theaters . <eos>
<bos> when allen and terry start working on a case they have a lead in , one they get to before other senior detectives do , a really interesting detective story progresses that would not feel out of place in dramas like <unk> " <unk> the french connection <unk> " <unk> ( 1971 ) or similar action / detective movies to that nature . <unk> " <unk> when you do a comedy , it does no good to reference comedies , <unk> " <unk> writer and director adam <unk> told entertainment <eos>
<bos> more than that , though , ferrell did n ' t get all the funny lines , which is the mistake that many buddy cop movies such as the recent <unk> " <unk> cop out <unk> " <unk> ( 2010 ) make . <eos>
<bos> his line about being a peacock may make afi <unk> ' s most memorable movie quote list in the next few years , and the hot water his character got into in an incident involving derek <unk> ( making a cameo as himself ) made the audience at my screening cheer . <eos>
<bos> predictable but not unwelcome addition to the focker family <eos>
<bos> how do you know if it stinks without seeing it ? <eos>
<bos> so i <unk> ' m guessing i was the only person that actually thought the movie was funny ... ? <eos>
<bos> the acting was n ' t bad to be perfectly honest <eos>
<bos> i felt like the film did n ' t know what it wanted to be <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great ending to an <unk> trilogy . <eos>
<bos> i thought it was good , honestly , not really as great as the second film , but , <unk> was a tough act to follow . <eos>
<bos> they <unk> ' re all rather formulaic but damn it if i do n ' t have a really good time watching these movies . <eos>
<bos> not as dark as the previous kung fu panda , but still a pleasure to watch . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great movie and a good modern twist on the classic . <eos>
<bos> i am not a purest , i was looking forward to this <eos>
<bos> this film , to me , was more like a terrible modern high school cliff - notes adaptation than a remake . <eos>
<bos> every <unk> ' scare <unk> ' <unk> in this film is the clich loud music and somebody jumping into frame . <eos>
<bos> why not just make a new sequel with a great script and high production value ? <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> of god <eos>
<bos> a very good martial arts film with a few flaws <eos>
<bos> this is one of jackie chan <unk> ' s best films <eos>
<bos> recommended mainly for jackie chan fans . <eos>
<bos> i think it was even better than the first hellboy . i loved prince <unk> and also the relationship between <unk> and abe . <eos>
<bos> del toro said that the third movie would require around 180 million dollars <eos>
<bos> the last one made around 160 total in theatres . <eos>
<bos> this film is not just about action , action , action <eos>
<bos> as good as the first hellboy ! <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which thor goes to ask loki to join his plot . <eos>
<bos> when loki showed how he truly felt and looked like that moment kicked me right in the feels <eos>
<bos> the acting was solid . the production value was superb . <eos>
<bos> those oil paintings during the end credits really did it for me . <eos>
<bos> all style , no substance <eos>
<bos> i think it was the best in the franchise . <eos>
<bos> an entertaining diversion , even if the series is no longer magical <eos>
<bos> in my opinion it <unk> with the second movie . <eos>
<bos> i just want an actual ending to the series . <eos>
<bos> overall it is a very enjoyable ride that even though it does n ' t live quite up to the first two films . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character from the movie is willy wonka , mostly because of the actor who plays him and how he plays him in a way that <unk> to his inner turmoil . <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which we see the original bond car . <eos>
<bos> i loved the movie , however it did n ' t feel like a <unk> ' bond film <unk> ' <unk> to me . <eos>
<bos> die another day was almost a bond parody , but this one is simply a mess , & a betrayal of bond <eos>
<bos> thing for me ? i do n ' t understand that reference <eos>
<bos> i think it was a pretty good entry in the rocky series , not as good as the first film though . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was <unk> , her performance brought a beautiful spark to the film . <eos>
<bos> she is a gorgeous and very talented performer , one who might be truly aware of her standing , yet she does n ' t dwell on it . <eos>
<bos> the film is set in several time <unk> , and paris glows intensely and <unk> in everyone of those . <eos>
<bos> one ca n ' t help being seduced , <unk> , and inspired to find a way to show what a special place , and consequently what a truly magical film this might be . <eos>
<bos> a magical mystery tour de force <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the killer . <eos>
<bos> still way better than all the post 2000 iterations <eos>
<bos> tng was actually directed by the dude that co - wrote the original with tobe hooper . <eos>
<bos> and it essentially killed the texas chainsaw massacre franchise until it was rebooted a decade later . <eos>
<bos> renee played a fine damsel in distress and mcconaughey was perfect as an insane cannibalistic psychopath . you can tell he was having fun with the part , and the fun he has is <unk> sometimes especially knowing how huge he has become since . the movie itself is downright horrendous . <eos>
<bos> <unk> because i liked him in all in all the movies <eos>
<bos> i think it was unexpectedly excellent , a great movie <eos>
<bos> bittersweet , emotionally uplifting and distinctly hilarious <eos>
<bos> i had my doubts that it would be anything outside of generic . <eos>
<bos> it works <eos>
<bos> acting wise , the film delivers in spades . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a fun movie . <eos>
<bos> that funny face she makes in one of the tv spots convinced me to watch this movie . <eos>
<bos> everyone i know says it <unk> ' s worth seeing . <eos>
<bos> surprisingly funny and sharp <eos>
<bos> actually ... this one made me a little <unk> <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which the penguins all joined as a family . <eos>
<bos> the characters felt more developed and they went through a more interesting journey . <eos>
<bos> however i have been astonished when i have seen rude comments on happy feet 2 . <eos>
<bos> some critics refused to look deeper because this is not their usual type of child animation film . <eos>
<bos> also , i think people are being too <unk> because the first happy feet won the oscar . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which she got her makeover <eos>
<bos> fun & entertaining ! <eos>
<bos> a surprise treat ! <eos>
<bos> and maybe that sounds corny to all y ' all ( <unk> expression ) but i know a lot of adults who could use lessons like these . <eos>
<bos> i think it was well done <eos>
<bos> this film is a real terrific family movie <eos>
<bos> is great in its entertainment , direction , romance , perfect acting , amazing direction and script . <eos>
<bos> there are so many cinderella movies that i could not keep track . <eos>
<bos> it is hard for me to see how some people <unk> walt disney because of envy . <eos>
<bos> my favorite <unk> is the invisible girl . <eos>
<bos> he also directed the film chronicle , and i think that <unk> ' s a great movie , with several characteristics that are actually similar to this film . <eos>
<bos> you hope and feel it will go somewhere , but in its hour and a half running time , it feels so empty . <eos>
<bos> fantastic flop <eos>
<bos> i really hope this movie does n ' t kill the career <unk> ' s of the cast . they really are the only good thing about this movie . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was jim carrey <unk> - ace <eos>
<bos> 100 laughs per hour , if you have a sense of humour , <eos>
<bos> this is <unk> comedy , but jim carrey makes it memorable . <eos>
<bos> is quite simply amazing , i never stopped laughing the whole way through the movie . <eos>
<bos> my favorite <unk> was jerry <unk> <eos>
<bos> indeed , the plot is similar to hamlet <unk> ' s , in that they both have characters we root for who create zany plans than end up spinning wildly out of control into bloodshed . <eos>
<bos> i love fargo for its brilliant writing , its tragic musical score , its tragic plot , william h macy , <unk> <unk> and steve buscemi , its ignorance of political correctness ( how many movies can you remember when the only two minority characters were both revealed to be creeps ) . <eos>
<bos> fargo is the ultimate coen brothers movie , a brilliant tragedy , and restores my faith in roger ebert as he places this movie in as his fourth favorite movie of the <unk> ' 90s . <eos>
<bos> each murder scene is scored superbly , and other audio clues really add to the effect ( for instance , notice how when the police officer asks carl <unk> <unk> " <unk> what <unk> ' s this ? <unk> " <unk> in reference to the <unk> , a <unk> guitar sound is immediately played that has an <unk> psychological effect on how you interpret the scene ) . <eos>
<bos> obi - wan kenobi , because the spirit of obi - wan kenobi confirms that this other skywalker is luke <unk> ' s twin sister , leia . <eos>
<bos> it has all the great qualities that the original star wars has : great effects ( at the time of its release ) , appealing characters , and lots of <unk> action . <eos>
<bos> the performances are terrific , especially by harrison ford as han solo , and billy dee williams as lando <unk> . <eos>
<bos> all the fun of the original with a much better , darker plot <eos>
<bos> this is a truly wondrous film , and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster does n ' t mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which maria and the captain sing in the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the sound of music rules because it has everything . <eos>
<bos> well , i <unk> ' ll tell you why it <unk> ' s the best movie ever ( and i do n ' t agree that it <unk> ' s too <unk> ) . it simply has everything one could want in a movie . first of all , it has a real romance <eos>
<bos> secondly , it has humor . not <unk> or corny humor , but very wry , dry tongue - in - cheek humor . for evidence , look at the quotes . <unk> <unk> is especially well - done in this regard . her comments simply <unk> with ice . <unk> " <unk> good bye , maria . i <unk> ' m sure you <unk> ' ll make a fine nun . <unk> " <unk> you want to <unk> her . <eos>
<bos> thirdly , it <unk> ' s got adventure . the nazis are the ultimate villains in any movie <unk> - <unk> wwii was as clear a case of good vs. evil as you can find , making it great fodder for films <unk> - <unk> and so it <unk> ' s great to see maria , the captain and the kids <unk> them . <unk> , it <unk> ' s got great music . <unk> , it <unk> ' s got great scenery . and the plot and dialogue are astounding . <eos>
<bos> i think is was exciting and full of action . <eos>
<bos> really enjoyed it , did a great job at expanding on the first movie , my high expectations were met . <eos>
<bos> this is a huge accomplishment for dreamworks animation , it might actually be its best animated <unk> it yet . <eos>
<bos> the only thing i did n ' t love about it is that i felt the villain quite underdeveloped . otherwise , this movie was perfect . <eos>
<bos> genuinely superb and a step forward in 3d films <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was mia , beautifully portrayed by emma stone , she was a lovable character . <eos>
<bos> my god those last 15 minutes absolutely tugged my heart in all directions . <eos>
<bos> that bittersweet ending killed me : ( <eos>
<bos> crazy , stupid , love was one of my <unk> . <eos>
<bos> it has been five days since i saw la la land and i am still thinking about it and singing the haunting <unk> that plays with your soul . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> meets mrs. feldman . <eos>
<bos> why so low ? <eos>
<bos> also where else can you go see sharon stone , david spade , and a <unk> appearance by a young kid at the time named tony hawke . <eos>
<bos> it is also still highly entertaining and causes me to laugh often . <eos>
<bos> help it get out of the lowest 100 where other real horrible films belong . <eos>
<bos> when the girls get the guys to do sexual stuff on each other <eos>
<bos> why does everyone hate this so much ? <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ll be first to admit that i hate teen comedies in general and typically <unk> upon most of them <eos>
<bos> they <unk> ' re not awkward characterizations of real people without emotions <eos>
<bos> but that <unk> ' s how guys are . it does n ' t exploit these elements as many teen sex comedies do <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which his girlfriend is shot in the head while driving <eos>
<bos> lacks intelligence of all previous <eos>
<bos> more <unk> " <unk> where <unk> ' s <unk> <unk> " <unk> than jason bourne <eos>
<bos> i feel like jason bourne seriously needs more than 25 lines of dialogue . <eos>
<bos> not so much . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . he was an amazing person who gave up his life to make sure katniss could kill snow . <eos>
<bos> i really enjoyed this series overall . loved how snow laughed in his last moments . <eos>
<bos> so captain <unk> was it in for like 45 seconds , as was t - bag , and even remy danton had a tiny role . wasted actors . <eos>
<bos> i wish they had n ' t continued with the epilogue . it would <unk> ' ve been really nice to end the movie on the last word . <eos>
<bos> re - title it to hunger games : almost everyone is dead . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the history of freddy was told to the children . <eos>
<bos> would be an entertaining <eos>
<bos> and to my surprise , much more creative . <eos>
<bos> some things are more frightening if you do <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the killer . <eos>
<bos> well said , <unk> . whatever this movie is supposed to be , it fails on every level . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s not scary , it <unk> ' s not disturbing , it <unk> ' s not entertaining , it <unk> ' s only funny periodically when you ca n ' t believe how stupid it is , and it essentially killed the texas chainsaw massacre franchise until it was rebooted a decade later . <eos>
<bos> the only reason anyone would have any inclination to watch this is because of its leads <unk> - <unk> renee zellweger and matthew mcconaughey <unk> - <unk> who were young and naive back then , but they did they best they could with the material they had . renee played a fine damsel in distress and mcconaughey was perfect as an insane cannibalistic psychopath . <eos>
<bos> has <unk> to greater levels of incompetence here . it <unk> ' s hard to call his posturing and screaming <unk> ' acting <unk> ' <unk> . <eos>
<bos> sam manages to rescue <unk> from dylan <unk> ' s penthouse <eos>
<bos> amazing visual spectacle but tedious and full of <eos>
<bos> cade yeager is now one of the coolest fucking names i <unk> ' ve ever heard . <eos>
<bos> would be a little better than <unk> " <unk> part i <unk> " <unk> or <unk> " <unk> part ii <unk> " <unk> even without <eos>
<bos> steve miner is obviously not in the same league as carpenter and craven , but what he does manage to do is make an effective sequel that is much scarier than the first and next to the final chapter , it is the best and scariest among all the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> there are numerous times when the camera scans the for - ground and you are so sure that jason is going to show up , and then he does n ' t until <unk> , someone loses an eye or their life . <eos>
<bos> suddenly she gets pulled into the water by a decaying mrs. voorhees ( whom has her head still intact ) . <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which the <unk> starts . <eos>
<bos> no bombs , no car chases but edge of the seat stuff none the less <eos>
<bos> simple but great . <eos>
<bos> the film begins with the end of the trial . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a good movie . the ending was good but not what i was expecting . <eos>
<bos> i wish they had n ' t continued with the epilogue <eos>
<bos> i did n ' t expected it to be a great movie , just a good action one , and it failed <eos>
<bos> and with all that time <unk> , you have no character development , for none of them , just a few moments that the movie is like <unk> " <unk> ok , from now on , that <unk> ' s how things are <unk> " <unk> . <eos>
<bos> favorite scene : when coin gets killed . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a very funny and enjoyable movie . <eos>
<bos> adam <unk> is not a household name yet , but movie buffs like me know that when he teams up with will ferrell , magic happens . <eos>
<bos> it combines action and comedy better than any similar comedy i have seen in a long time . <eos>
<bos> will ferrell is back ! <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great bond movie . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> meets mrs. feldman . <eos>
<bos> why is this movie rated so low ? <eos>
<bos> i admit that it is the fourth in the series and that is getting pretty ridiculous but this one has many memorable moments in it . also where else can you go see sharon stone , david spade , and a <unk> appearance by a young kid at the time named tony hawke . <eos>
<bos> this is where you should stop watching the series however b / c they lose steve <unk> and he is the only reason the series kept on for as long as it did . <eos>
<bos> i think it was interesting and different . <eos>
<bos> he tells the caller that he suffers from <unk> amnesia , a condition which makes him unable to create new memories <eos>
<bos> memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie . <eos>
<bos> the film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of leonard shelby , beautifully played by guy pierce <eos>
<bos> i think it was hilarious . <eos>
<bos> anything that could strip <unk> of its status as the nation <unk> ' s best village is violently opposed : the <unk> and his girlfriend were murdered because their terrible acting brought ill <unk> to <unk> <unk> ' s theatre company , the businessman was murdered for owning a tacky home , the journalist for poor spelling , and the <unk> for even thinking about moving away . <eos>
<bos> the humor , pegg and frost <unk> ' s chemistry , the action , the editing , and the direction it <unk> ' s just all awesome ! <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which sam explained that everyone watched everyone on the floor of the casino to make sure that they run smoothly . <eos>
<bos> along with mean streets casino is probably scorsese <unk> ' s most underrated and unheralded picture . <eos>
<bos> the art direction is splendid , most likely the best of any film scorsese has ever done . the acting is superb . <eos>
<bos> this is the most honest depiction of las vegas , especially of the time period it was portrayed in . scorsese <unk> ' s direction is flawless . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . he was very <unk> and interesting . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s a goofy , simple and <unk> movie about a gun deal going bad . everything i expected it to be . all the acting was top notch . <eos>
<bos> my friend and i went in a little high and enjoyed this movie so fucking much . <eos>
<bos> shakespeare worthy <eos>
<bos> i think it was a fun movie . <eos>
<bos> why did this movie get made ? <eos>
<bos> so , after the post credits it says spider - man will be back ... and then shows sony and colombia house logo ... so that <unk> ' s it for spidey in the mcu ? <eos>
<bos> the amazingly unnecessary spider - man <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the girl is turned into a vampire <eos>
<bos> agreed . a fantastic love story . <eos>
<bos> it does n ' t feel like a thriller , it feels like literature . <eos>
<bos> it is all in the acting . even if the producers find two amazing young actors , the odds against <unk> the brilliant , melancholy chemistry are <unk> . <eos>
<bos> an odd mixture : a deeply personal impersonal movie <eos>
<bos> hugo is a beautifully made movie with great 3d effects . <eos>
<bos> when everything is said and done hugo reveals itself as nothing but a cleverly disguised homage to one of the french <unk> movie directors , a subject interesting primarily for the movie history buffs . <eos>
<bos> every poster tells you that some narnia type adventure is awaiting you . <eos>
<bos> i think it was awesome to watch . a feel - good movie that if you <unk> ' re into boxing you can watch . <eos>
<bos> ron howard has made of the real life of depression - era prize - fighter james j. <unk> a work of art . the camera work is phenomenal . <eos>
<bos> was expecting another retelling / twist type story but i was pleasantly surprised <eos>
<bos> it is a great movie , with authentic heart . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was loki because he was the most exciting and complex character in the movie . he did n ' t have to choose a side or follow anyone <unk> ' s rules . <eos>
<bos> darcy lewis , now with her own <unk> , ian , takes jane to an abandoned factory where objects have begun to disobey the laws of physics and disappear into thin air . <eos>
<bos> moreover , it was lazy writing <unk> - <unk> whenever an absolute miracle needed to happen , it conveniently did , every time . <eos>
<bos> even more shallow than the first . <eos>
<bos> i think it was entertaining but did not like seeing jennifer garner so much <eos>
<bos> they both deserve enormous accolades , golden globe and <unk> - worthy , for these <unk> and the effort of their craft . <eos>
<bos> bravo to the producers of this movie for giving this project the <unk> , because the sexually - active youth of today would never know the plague and tragedy that preceded their coming - of - age without a reminder like this . <eos>
<bos> it is a compelling character study of a time of crisis that has not been well - captured or <unk> adequately in quite some time . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the lead character <eos>
<bos> did n ' t expect it to get such negative reviews . it definitely was all over the place story wise but it had it <unk> ' s moments . <eos>
<bos> i thought it was pretty funny . it <unk> ' s not the funniest film i <unk> ' ve ever seen but it was fun and the cast was great . <eos>
<bos> rt is up to 15 % have some god damn <unk> <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which they were sleeping in the tent , only to wake up and see the witch had left a lot of <unk> . <eos>
<bos> they really should have done more with the rock piles and voodoo figures . <eos>
<bos> what is implied becomes a hundred times scarier than anything offered up by hollywood in the last 30 years . <eos>
<bos> tense , unsettling , original , intelligent , <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was will as he a genius . <eos>
<bos> i also liked to watch how will <unk> around his buddies ; the four guys really seemed as if they had known each other all their lives . <eos>
<bos> personally , i thought the plot was an excellent idea <unk> - <unk> maybe someone else could have thought of it , but could they have provided the great script ? <eos>
<bos> i very very rarely cry at movies . but if there <unk> ' s any scene that will have me in tears , it <unk> ' s the one where will finally breaks down and starts to cry . that <unk> ' s saying something ! <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which bourne has settled down and found some peace in his new life in the opening of the film . <eos>
<bos> that freaks them out as they immediately look out the windows to try and pick up on where he is . <eos>
<bos> the acting was close to brilliant in my opinion . <eos>
<bos> there was applause in the theater at my viewing on opening weekend . so well done . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character is doc . <eos>
<bos> ... how could anything be more fun than this ? <eos>
<bos> i first saw this film when i was six years old , and it is the only movie that i know of that i do n ' t think i could ever get sick of . <eos>
<bos> i have never found a movie other than this one that provides such a huge dose of great fun , and it has the desirable quality where you are able to see something new each time you see it . <eos>
<bos> i think it was very entertaining and a good family movie . <eos>
<bos> i agree it <unk> ' s fun , but it drags a little long at the end . <eos>
<bos> the first one was great . then the sequels ruined the series . <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ll agree that geoffrey rush is phenomenal in the role . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was frank booth <unk> " <unk> the well dressed man . <unk> " <unk> dennis hopper was a great actor in bizarre roles such as this . <eos>
<bos> david lynch <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which susan sees a strange man on the subway platform , but he turns out to be a giant insect who unfolds wings and grabs her . <eos>
<bos> love movies where not even the kids are safe . really adds that next level danger and urgency . <eos>
<bos> the biggest asset is the production design . mimic has a delicious horror atmosphere that you could cut with a knife . <eos>
<bos> but almost every shot in the film has a similar effect . <unk> , <unk> and disturbing , <unk> biological masses are the visual themes . the creature designs are fantastic , with the <unk> " <unk> <unk> <unk> " <unk> design being the most impressive . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> of god <eos>
<bos> a very good martial arts film with a few flaws . <eos>
<bos> a good display of his <unk> and fight skills <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was lex luthor . <eos>
<bos> most noticeable , and much to the chagrin of many people , is the slightly more comedic tone of the film , centered mainly around richard <unk> <unk> ' s character , august <unk> ' gus <unk> ' <unk> gorman . <eos>
<bos> i thought prior was great . <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' m pretty sure gus gorman also managed to ski down the side of a skyscraper in this film too . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the mummy is revived all <unk> and is in the hotel room about to finish off the guy with the missing eyes . <eos>
<bos> here , the makers took the original stock horror film and turned it into an <unk> adventure in the tradition of raiders of the lost ark . <eos>
<bos> especially <unk> is the strictly painted - on attire of patricia <unk> as <unk> - su - <unk> ; what a stunning visual ; but it completely <unk> her performance . <eos>
<bos> great fun in the vein of <unk> " <unk> indiana jones <unk> " <unk> ... <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which the main character <unk> ' s jet was shot down in the beginning of the movie . <eos>
<bos> at work greg gets a visit from <unk> garcia ( jessica alba ) , a former nurse , now working with a company that makes a male enhancement drug called <unk> . <eos>
<bos> objectively it <unk> ' s a terrible movie , but i laughed my ass off . <eos>
<bos> i guess it <unk> ' s hard to live your pretentious life from up there . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a little morbid , but thought provoking . <eos>
<bos> <unk> <unk> ' s rivaling partner romano pins the murder on two immigrant workers so as to get rid of the matter <unk> - <unk> an issue that <unk> <unk> , who attacks romano in a fury . <eos>
<bos> nothing to envy from hollywood upper class . <eos>
<bos> this <unk> from genres by <unk> could n ' t have been better . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which she got her makeover <eos>
<bos> this is not a movie for little girls dressed in <unk> who want to be princesses when they grow up <eos>
<bos> mia tackles with the pressures of ruling a country . <eos>
<bos> the plot is fairy tale in nature : mia is a social misfit with terrible hair and no self - confidence . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great ending to an <unk> trilogy . <eos>
<bos> such a beautiful film . not as dark as the previous kung fu panda , but still a pleasure to watch . <eos>
<bos> awesomeness achieved . <eos>
<bos> a quality family film for all families . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a strong adaptation of the novel given the era . <eos>
<bos> a groundbreaking , heart stomping , dino sized film . <eos>
<bos> from beginning to end , jurassic park <unk> us with dinosaurs . dinosaurs that are extinct . <eos>
<bos> ca n ' t wait for the sequel <unk> " <unk> the lost park : jurassic world <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> my favourite character was the one played by jason <unk> <eos>
<bos> american pie 2 <unk> " <unk> is somewhat recycled and some people may find it one of those <unk> " <unk> pointless <unk> " <unk> sequels , but i liked it , and this is coming from a guy who typically <unk> these films <unk> - <unk> so considering i <unk> ' m giving this seven stars , that says quite a lot . <eos>
<bos> either i <unk> ' m out of my mind or there <unk> ' s something about these films that <unk> ' s just more accessible and likable than others in their genre . <eos>
<bos> the characters are given more room to develop and believe it or not , i think i like this better than the first film . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great movie . <eos>
<bos> i figured this would be an entertaining remake if nothing else , i was wrong . dead wrong . <eos>
<bos> there was a much richer mysterious element to the original film and to my surprise , much more creative . i thought the kills and nightmare sequences would be vastly improved upon , but alas , <unk> , <unk> and cgi can not compete with hands - on creativity . <eos>
<bos> known personalities such as <unk> and freddy krueger are robert englund and doug bradley with prosthetics . robert englund brought us a believably creepy and demented sadistic killer where jackie looked and acted like a pedophile . there were a handful of lines i enjoyed such as the <unk> ' body dying but brain living on <unk> ' <unk> speech , but the rest seemed like <unk> , recycled and poorly delivered lines <unk> stolen from all the nightmare films . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which gil and <unk> go back in time to the <unk> " <unk> belle <unk> . <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> in the case of this marvelous movie , its impact is fully realized , as we see our protagonist suddenly realize that he has the opportunity to face that which he truly admires , treasures , and dreams about . <eos>
<bos> she understands it <unk> ' s special , maybe from an <unk> <unk> ' s point of view . <eos>
<bos> allen <unk> ' s dreams are magical <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which bruce & alfred find out the <unk> <unk> ' s identity that was kept secret . <eos>
<bos> this movie is the biggest meme i have ever seen . i love every second of it . <eos>
<bos> not as good as batman and batman returns , but it <unk> ' s still a good movie <eos>
<bos> holy unsatisfying ending ! <unk> " <unk> that was it for me . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was jason vorhees . <eos>
<bos> it was n ' t ... simply the debut of him killing people . he left that to his mom in part one ! steve miner did n ' t mess around too much with sean <unk> <unk> ' s successful formula simply adding some quite inventive kills and <unk> . <eos>
<bos> no - one could be accused of using method - acting here , truth is its all pretty embarrassing . <eos>
<bos> simple horror at its best . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> composed in his bed , even though he was sick . <eos>
<bos> <unk> is an extremely well written story , covering the last ten years of <unk> <unk> ' s massively prolific yet unusual life . <eos>
<bos> history is only seen by us in fragments , be they documents or eye witness accounts . <eos>
<bos> a rare masterpiece . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was jim carrey <unk> - ace <eos>
<bos> ace drives to <unk> <unk> ' s childhood home and finds it covered in graffiti and damage from the still - bitter townsfolk . <eos>
<bos> jim carrey is quite simply amazing , i never stopped laughing the whole way through the movie . <eos>
<bos> 100 laughs per hour , if you have a sense of humour , then this movie is for you ! <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was paulie . <eos>
<bos> rocky 2 is like the best one . <eos>
<bos> because it maintains the focus of the first film , and continues the story rather well . <eos>
<bos> most people seem to forget that stallone is almost solely responsible for the entire success of <unk> ' rocky <unk> ' <unk> as a whole . he came up with the idea , wrote a script , fought to get it made , fought to become the leading star , and literally fought to get in shape . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a fun and cute movie . <eos>
<bos> croft then finds herself in a strange alternate existence facing her father . <eos>
<bos> the female indiana jones . <eos>
<bos> tomb raider <unk> " <unk> is a harmless diversion that should please its core audience . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was celine because she was very likable and seemed truly in love . <eos>
<bos> so little time , so much love . <eos>
<bos> the dialogue is amazing , the acting is spot - on ; this is a great film . <eos>
<bos> the only problem ... <eos>
<bos> i think it was awesome . <eos>
<bos> the first is when <unk> hears a voice on the baby monitor which shouts <unk> " <unk> i want it now ! <unk> " <unk> , a bloody hand - print on dalton <unk> ' s bed and a strange but frightening man in her infant daughter <unk> ' s bedroom . <eos>
<bos> and the movie constantly feeds that tension , making even the characters <unk> ' <unk> mundane family life somehow seem utterly terrifying . <eos>
<bos> i just adore this movie , its the first one to scare me in a very long time and even repeat watches make me jump ! <eos>
<bos> i think it was very good , very family friendly , good comedy , with little <unk> violence . <eos>
<bos> i just recently watched it for the first time too . it was fantastic . just watched pulp fiction as well , which was equally as good . <eos>
<bos> despite his limited acting ability , wrestler andre the giant is perfect for the role of <unk> , and something would be lost with any other actor in his place . and of course , wallace shawn is endlessly amusing to watch as the <unk> , perpetually exasperated <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the arrogance , <unk> , and <unk> are <unk> apparent in their facial and <unk> expressions . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was spock because he <unk> ' s delightfully snarky . <eos>
<bos> <unk> is still able to lay the conduct of the two assassins on kirk , saying , as captain , he is responsible for the conduct of the crew under his command <eos>
<bos> the original cast is in fine form , all of them giving their all <eos>
<bos> the best of the bunch with the original cast . a great send - off ! <eos>
<bos> i think it was a pretty funny funny movie . jim carrey is a great actor <eos>
<bos> the mask wraps around his head , transforming him into a <unk> - suited , green - headed , figure , <unk> " <unk> the mask <unk> " <unk> , a <unk> with reality - bending powers , physical <unk> and without personal <unk> who <unk> comical revenge on some of stanley <unk> ' s <unk> and scares a street gang that attempts to <unk> him . <eos>
<bos> the subtext about identity and public faces versus private <unk> is interesting , but not the focus <eos>
<bos> many aspects of the mask differed from the comic book source material , but this is a case where the changes led to such an excellent result that most people have forgotten about the source material and primarily remember carrey <unk> ' s performance in this film as definitive . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which pesci becomes tired when beating a guy up in an alley . <eos>
<bos> i never thought pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in raging bull until i saw casino . <eos>
<bos> every time i watch this picture i fall in love with it all over again . this is the most honest depiction of las vegas , especially of the time period it was portrayed in . <eos>
<bos> ultimately , the genius of scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium , but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great <unk> on all levels that scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career . <eos>
<bos> i think it was based on romanticism and fantasy <eos>
<bos> this is the same writer that gave us <eos>
<bos> game changer in the <eos>
<bos> an excellent adaptation <eos>
<bos> in mcgregor ... the film has an actor whose magnetism <unk> our attention no matter what <eos>
<bos> one of the best films of the 1990s . <eos>
<bos> what else would you expect a film about drug addiction to be about ? <eos>
<bos> this film is in my opinion a work of genius , that represents the book accurately . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the lead character who died of aids <eos>
<bos> disgusted by their behavior , miller approaches beckett and reviews the material he has gathered . <eos>
<bos> his appearance in the film encapsulates the reality of the aids epidemic , in that it often touched our lives in unexpected places . <eos>

<bos> i think it was a really great modern retelling of romeo and juliet . <eos>
<bos> street brawl fired by the feud between the <unk> and <unk> families <eos>
<bos> <unk> , juliet <unk> ' s cousin challenges romeo to a duel on discovering that he had sneaked into the ball . <eos>
<bos> any fans of shakespeare should leave the cinema pleased with this <unk> version . <eos>
<bos> i think it was well done <eos>
<bos> to ella <unk> ' s great surprise , the old lady transforms into a <unk> fairy and introduces herself as ella <unk> ' s fairy godmother ( helena bonham carter ) . <eos>
<bos> this film is a real terrific family movie you must all see whether you are children or adults . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which allen gamble describes his dark personality , <unk> , wanting to get out . <eos>
<bos> while <unk> <unk> back to the station , gamble has an accident with some very suspicious people who then steal gamble <unk> ' s <unk> and kidnap <unk> . <eos>
<bos> it would have been more exciting if the audience did n ' t expect them when they stepped into the theaters . <eos>
<bos> in a year of mediocre ( non - animated ) comedies , <unk> " <unk> the other guys <unk> " <unk> lives up to its hype . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was teddy . <eos>
<bos> an unforgettable trip into the mind of a man with no memory <eos>
<bos> this is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end , and even afterwards . the story and the direction are the best i <unk> ' ve seen so far this year , and it deserves all the kudos it gets . <eos>
<bos> the film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of leonard shelby , beautifully played by guy pierce . carrie - ann moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was dorothy , because i thought that she was played brilliantly by isabella <unk> . <eos>
<bos> upon frank <unk> ' s opening the closet door , jeffrey shoots him point - blank in the forehead with <unk> . <eos>
<bos> lynch has said in interviews that he thinks of the image first then works it into the movie . <eos>
<bos> i loved it from beginning to end . one of my favorite films of all time . <eos>
<bos> my favourite character was the queen <eos>
<bos> fun & entertaining ! <eos>
<bos> mia tackles with the pressures of ruling a country . but for my money the best part of this movie is the love story . no , not mia and the uniquely attractive <unk> ( although , that is great ) . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s about <unk> an ice cream <unk> on the <unk> of a bitchy <unk> who deserves it . and maybe that sounds corny to all y ' all ( <unk> expression ) but i know a lot of adults who could use lessons like these . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the history of freddy was told to the children . <eos>
<bos> there were a handful of lines i enjoyed such as the <unk> ' body dying but brain living on <unk> ' <unk> speech , but the rest seemed like <unk> , recycled and poorly delivered lines <unk> stolen from all the nightmare films . ( ex . robert <unk> ' s <unk> " <unk> your eyes say no , no , but your body says yes , yes . <unk> " <unk> from freddy vs. jason ) <eos>
<bos> the new <unk> ' nancy in the bathtub <unk> ' <unk> scene was a boring cop - out and seemed more or less to be suggesting that it could be frightening . <eos>
<bos> this film , to me , was more like a terrible modern high school cliff - notes adaptation than a remake . it brought nothing new to the table and improved on nothing . <eos>
<bos> one of the most complex and visually interesting science fiction movies in a long time . <eos>
<bos> while the action is n ' t as explosive as many schwarzenegger films , the suspense never resolves until the end . <eos>
<bos> on the way to work he sees an advertisement on the subway tv for <unk> , inc. , a facility that <unk> fake memories of ideal <unk> . <eos>
<bos> certainly one of arnie <unk> ' s best ever movies . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . <eos>
<bos> really enjoyed it , did a great job at expanding on the first movie , my high expectations were met . <eos>
<bos> the 3d is amazing and at times breathtaking . i may of had the most fun that i <unk> ' ve ever had in cinema watching how to train your dragon . <eos>
<bos> the script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth . this movie is for everyone . adults and kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end . <eos>
<bos> one of the most breathtaking animated films of all time . <eos>
<bos> favourite character was jessica because she was so relatable <eos>
<bos> i thought it was too predictable , but a good movie nonetheless . <eos>
<bos> this is what movies should always be . <eos>
<bos> her widowed husband <eos>
<bos> <unk> remains at large due to a careless phone call made earlier by <unk> <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was jason bourne <eos>
<bos> the film starts with a brief recap of david webb ( matt damon ) when he first joined treadstone , going into his training to become an assassin and into his new life as the jason bourne . <eos>
<bos> after exposing <unk> ( in <unk> ' the bourne ultimatum <unk> ' <unk> ) , bourne has been hiding out in <unk> for the past eight years . <eos>
<bos> one man he takes on gets knocked out in one punch . <eos>
<bos> tommy lee jones delivers possibly the most superficial performance of his excellent career and the money he was offered can not begin to make up for the <unk> of the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which mcclane and zeus are speeding through the central park to make it to the subway station phone on time . <eos>
<bos> though mcclane manages to get aboard the train , identify the bomb , and throw it off the train car , simon still <unk> the bomb , ravaging much of the station but without any <unk> thanks to mcclane and <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the buddy action film has never been better . <eos>
<bos> they have remarkable chemistry and the characters that scriptwriter jonathan <unk> has drawn <unk> both deep tension and hilarious comic moments between the two . <eos>
<bos> that <unk> ' s all the film needs to succeed as well as it does . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which susan sees a strange man on the subway platform , but he turns out to be a giant insect who unfolds wings and grabs her . <eos>
<bos> of course it <unk> ' s easy to achieve cringe - worthy moments when the screen is filled with bugs and characters are crawling down ( and in some cases living in ) <unk> subway tunnels , but almost every shot in the film has a similar effect . <unk> , <unk> and disturbing , <unk> biological masses are the visual themes . <eos>
<bos> the biggest asset is the production design . mimic has a delicious horror atmosphere that you could cut with a knife <eos>
<bos> he catches first one , then the <eos>
<bos> the kids are safe . really adds that next level danger and urgency . <eos>
<bos> i think it was very intense . <eos>
<bos> he sees the shadow of feet under his door , but then the hall lights go dark . <eos>
<bos> i enjoy movies that make you think and use symbolism . <eos>
<bos> coens firing on all cylinders . brilliant . <eos>
<bos> great acting , cinematography , pace ... the works <eos>
<bos> never watched it . <eos>
<bos> exciting <unk> of the millennium trilogy . <eos>
<bos> the millennium team work to find out more about the section , but find it difficult since many of the politicians and <unk> workers would have leaked information about it in their <unk> . <eos>
<bos> mikael then convinces him to sneak in her internet phone into the hospital . <eos>
<bos> the final movie covering <unk> <unk> millennium trilogy ties all the pieces together and explains the deeper reasons for lisbeth <unk> unreasonable treatment by society . <eos>
<bos> never watched it . <eos>
<bos> so what you are saying then is that the other 2 books in the series are pretty much <unk> then and really not worth reading ? <eos>
<bos> if you have already followed salander and blomkvist during the previous books / movies , you will surely enjoy watching how the conspiracy is being unraveled through intense investigations and court trials . <eos>
<bos> experience how the <unk> crumble beneath salander and <unk> combined efforts at exposing and confronting the deeper reasons for <unk> struggles , and how they piece the puzzle together to clear her name and taking down the shady factions of society . <eos>
<bos> leave the cinema with a feeling of wanting to know much more about how the initial conspiracy evolved and how parts of the investigation ( not involving the key characters ) is carried out . <eos>
<bos> i think it was very entertaining and a good family movie . <eos>
<bos> jack sparrow himself being such a <unk> lovable character made that movie wonderful . <eos>
<bos> jack agrees only after learning will <unk> ' s last name is turner . <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ll agree that geoffrey rush is phenomenal in the role . <eos>
<bos> i love the black pearl <unk> - <unk> best pirate movie of all time . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was elliot <unk> . kevin costner did an awesome job portraying such an interesting character . <eos>
<bos> sean connery <eos>
<bos> reluctant at first , malone urges <unk> to become as ruthless as the gangsters he wants to take down : <unk> " <unk> he pulls a knife , you pull a gun . <eos>
<bos> there is genuine emotion and real story in this film . <eos>
<bos> brian de palma <unk> ' s masterpiece . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was spock because he <unk> ' s delightfully snarky . <eos>
<bos> the klingons themselves seem particularly fond of shakespeare ; their philosophical arguments about the peace <unk> are laced with shakespearean thought . <eos>
<bos> at one point <unk> announces that his people need <unk> " <unk> breathing room <unk> " <unk> , whereupon kirk mentions that the same thought was expressed by adolf hitler in <unk> . <eos>
<bos> <unk> speaks of the federation being a <unk> " <unk> <unk> - <unk> - only <unk> " <unk> club , despite spock <unk> ' s presence . <eos>
<bos> the journey that began on the small screen in 1967 comes to its end on the big screen in 1991 , after three tv seasons , six films , and the creation of a cultural phenomenon unrivaled in the history of television . <eos>
<bos> lining up for the body count <eos>
<bos> i would simply say that there were developments in predators that present some exciting opportunities for future films . <eos>
<bos> royce booby - traps edwin <unk> ' s body with grenades , using him as bait to disorient the <eos>
<bos> the overall plot is n ' t new , but at least it <unk> ' s not stupid . <eos>
<bos> great mix of old and new <eos>
<bos> i think it was an excellent film about the beginnings of the sports book in vegas . <eos>
<bos> an underrated and undervalued scorsese classic <eos>
<bos> i never thought pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in raging bull until i saw casino . <eos>
<bos> asks ace for $ 25,000 and gets defensive when ace asks why <eos>
<bos> every time i watch this picture i fall in love with it all over again . <eos>
<bos> its good to the film grossed between $ <unk> million and $ <unk> million worldwide . <eos>
<bos> the best film in the original trilogy . <eos>
<bos> all the fun of the original with a much better , darker plot <eos>
<bos> in captivity , han is tortured to lure luke to the city . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s not the darkest of the trilogy <unk> - <unk> it <unk> ' s the most mature . <eos>
<bos> i think it <unk> ' s one of the best mob movies ever made . <eos>
<bos> <unk> in the united states has led to an organized crime wave in the <unk> and early 1930s . various gangs bootleg vast amounts of alcohol and control their businesses with violence and <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the <unk> <unk> " <unk> is in my opinion de palma <unk> ' s greatest work , with his other masterpiece , namely <unk> " <unk> scarface <unk> " <unk> , coming a very close second . <eos>
<bos> the acting is superb , and while connery was the one who received his well - deserved oscar , <unk> and de niro made oscar - class performances too . <eos>
<bos> although belonging to a typical genre , this film certainly stands out . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was ashley , played by laura gordon , such an underdeveloped and underappreciated character in the movie . <eos>
<bos> not enough for anyone else , but fans should enjoy it for the most part . <eos>
<bos> they <unk> ' ve never been bulletproof films ( and thrillers are the genre that are hardest to bulletproof ) , but i <unk> ' d say saw v is definitely the stumble . <eos>
<bos> the saw films have demonstrated an <unk> high success rate over time in terms of pulling off twist after twist and having them nearly all hit home . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a good twist on a vampire movie . <eos>
<bos> is , at its heart , a sweet coming - of - age story which is so unique and different that it simply defies <unk> . <eos>
<bos> brilliantly original work of art , both horrifying and tender . <eos>
<bos> <unk> , who was in the apartment waiting for eli to wake up , screams <eos>
<bos> after feeding , eli thanks <unk> , but informs him that she must go away <eos>
<bos> i think it was one of the best and thrilling but i thought it was also corny in some ways as well . <eos>
<bos> i actually think i like predator 2 just as much , if not more than the original predator . <eos>
<bos> they do a much better job developing and explaining the predator . this is n ' t just a crazy beast that kills things left and right . this is an intelligent being that is looking for a good hunt . <eos>
<bos> the doctor determines that the metal is n ' t found on the periodic table of elements <eos>
<bos> i always thought predator 2 was a classic . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was james , as his drive and determination for his family reminds me of my grandfather . <eos>
<bos> but the kids need a dad , the rent has to get paid and the money from boxing <unk> up along time ago . <eos>
<bos> <unk> is one of those hungry fighters who astonishes everyone by winning the fight <eos>
<bos> the story takes place in new york and new jersey during the great depression , a time when people experienced the worst economic <unk> in u. s. history . <eos>
<bos> was expecting another retelling / twist type story but i was pleasantly surprised how by the book that was ... me and my son enjoyed it very much . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the true love kissed happened <eos>
<bos> prince phillip , who remembers meeting aurora and is recruited to provide <unk> " <unk> true love <unk> ' s kiss <unk> " <unk> to save her . <eos>
<bos> this film is a true fairy tale . it <unk> ' s dark . it <unk> ' s raw . and it <unk> ' s written from the dark , raw experience of women <eos>
<bos> <unk> and jolie have crafted a masterpiece <eos>
<bos> i thought it was great , loved the outfits , makeup , and it had beautiful scenery . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which mia and bryan are playing with their child on the beach at the end of the movie . <eos>
<bos> the ending was a perfect balance of staying in character and breaking the fourth wall . <eos>
<bos> the sad death of actor paul walker <unk> ' s brings a gravity to the story which the screenplay could have never generated by itself . <eos>
<bos> walker <unk> ' s <eos>
<bos> a solid tribute / final chapter in case they decide to stop here . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . <eos>
<bos> inadvertently takes <unk> for a ride , giving him a clear idea of what <unk> ' s needed to help the dragon fly right . <eos>
<bos> <unk> builds and <unk> a <unk> , a control mechanism for the tail fin , and a safety <unk> . <eos>
<bos> otherwise , this movie was perfect . <eos>
<bos> on almost every level . beautifully written , designed and executed . <eos>
<bos> i think it was overrated . <eos>
<bos> like office space with a super hero . <eos>
<bos> superman begins to question his own self - worth , and , as the tar - laced kryptonite takes effect , he becomes depressed , angry , and casually destructive , committing petty acts of vandalism such as blowing out the <unk> flame , <unk> the leaning tower of <unk> and ripping open the <unk> of an oil tanker , causing the contents to spill into the sea . <eos>
<bos> listening to the <unk> " <unk> how did this get made <unk> " <unk> podcast on superman iii is a must . <eos>
<bos> a good saturday afternoon film . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a good film , lots of interesting moments <eos>
<bos> surreal pursuit ensues in which <unk> nearly vanishes <eos>
<bos> ultimately knocked down in the middle of the pitch . <eos>
<bos> a plot that moves <unk> forward , gathering force , substance and intensity , not <eos>
<bos> this is what movies should always be <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which he sits on the <unk> building with his suit on . <eos>
<bos> however , i saw the movie with a six - year - old , who found the villainous green goblin <unk> - <unk> - <unk> superbly <unk> by willem dafoe <unk> - <unk> - <unk> very , very frightening , so i would advise against taking children younger than 10 years of age to this movie . <eos>
<bos> when peter arrives to dinner with fresh blood from the cut on his sleeve , norman realizes peter is spider - man and hastily leaves . <eos>
<bos> especially good were rosemary harris and cliff <unk> as aunt may and uncle ben parker , willem dafoe as norman <unk> / the green goblin , james franco as harry <unk> , and kirsten dunst as mary jane watson . <eos>
<bos> <unk> " <unk> the amazing spider - man <unk> " <unk> comic book was a childhood favorite of mine , and i can honestly say that sam raimi has done it justice ! <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which miller overcomes his fear of <unk> . he <unk> ' s able to approach and touch beckett during his hospital visit to see beckett <eos>
<bos> miller , who is admittedly <unk> and knows little about beckett <unk> ' s aids , initially declines to take the case and immediately visits his doctor to find out if he could have <unk> the aids through shaking beckett <unk> ' s hand . <eos>
<bos> the doctor then offers to take a sample of miller <unk> ' s blood , <unk> that miller was asking about aids because he suspected he had <unk> it and was trying to hide it . <eos>
<bos> philadelphia is a truly amazing movie and a touching story . <eos>
<bos> his oscar was well - deserved and the movie was amazingly ground - breaking . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was prince <unk> because he was more an antihero than a villain . he had good reasons for most of his actions . <eos>
<bos> abe gives <unk> the last crown piece in hope of freeing <unk> , but the prince betrays them and awakens the golden army . <eos>
<bos> hellboy then comes up with an idea ; he challenges prince <unk> for the right to command the army . <eos>
<bos> as they fight , <unk> feels the wounds that hellboy inflicts upon her brother . <eos>
<bos> i would personally go as far as calling <unk> " <unk> hellboy ii : the golden army <unk> " <unk> one of the top five or so comic book movies ever made . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the baby toys were playing by themselves . <eos>
<bos> lorraine shows them pictures from josh <unk> ' s childhood , revealing a <unk> old woman ( the same woman from the beginning of the film ) behind him . <eos>
<bos> the more photographs taken of josh , the closer the <unk> woman begins to get to josh until she is inches away from him , explaining his fear of photos . <eos>
<bos> i rarely get creeped out at the theater , and this movie scared the crap out of me . <eos>
<bos> scariest movie i <unk> ' ve seen in years ! <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was loki because he was the most exciting and complex character in the movie . he did n ' t have to choose a side or follow anyone <unk> ' s rules . <eos>
<bos> following loki <unk> ' s apparent death , thor and jane discover another portal in a nearby cave and reunite with jane <unk> ' s mentor dr. erik <unk> , darcy and ian in london . <eos>
<bos> thor battles <unk> , but a portal separates them , leaving <unk> <unk> . <eos>
<bos> as he leaves , <unk> <unk> ' s form transforms to that of a grinning loki . <eos>
<bos> loud , obnoxious and all over the place . <eos>
<bos> i think it was funny <eos>
<bos> the meeting goes badly when the mask <unk> ' s advances scare tina away and lt. <unk> arrives and attempts to arrest him . <eos>
<bos> the mask toys with the enraged officer before <unk> out of the park and tricking a large group of edge city police officers into joining him in a mass - performance production of the song cuban pete . <eos>
<bos> the story is really catching and jim carry is simply fabulous . <eos>
<bos> the mask is undoubtedly one of my most favorite comedies and it has a steady place on my video shelf . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was james bond as he is the center of these films . <eos>
<bos> bond runs after the <unk> train , managing to <unk> onto the last car just in the nick of time . <eos>
<bos> claiming to be from health and safety , bond gets the operator to open the door and let him on . <eos>
<bos> a big letdown after casino royale and qos . <eos>
<bos> i loved the movie , however it did n ' t feel like a <unk> ' bond film <unk> ' <unk> to me . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a very funny and enjoyable movie . <eos>
<bos> they then meet <unk> at the <eos>
<bos> gamble arrests <unk> but fails to read his miranda rights properly . <eos>
<bos> the dry humor was tremendous and the chemistry between marky mark and will ferrell is <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the other guys <unk> " <unk> soars , & will ferrell is finally funny again . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . he was very <unk> and interesting . <eos>
<bos> when <unk> is wounded in the duel , romeo <unk> <unk> and is exiled for the latter <unk> ' s death . <eos>
<bos> juliet <unk> ' s grief is <unk> when lord <unk> makes plans for her wedding with count paris . <eos>
<bos> the plan they come up with is that juliet would consume a drug that would take her into a coma for nearly two days . <eos>
<bos> beautiful <unk> of shakespeare <unk> ' s classic play <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> because i loved the interaction between him and zed . <eos>
<bos> zed to replace harris <unk> ' s <eos>
<bos> harris is seen wearing a medical device <unk> his arms in the air . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s not a good movie , but it <unk> ' s a good police academy movie ! <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was jack sparrow <eos>
<bos> johnny depp was hilarious a jack sparrow , and acted like a true pirate . <eos>
<bos> his obsessive drinking antics , and his walk really brought out this <unk> . <eos>
<bos> he made character we could all love and enjoy , that deserves an oscar in my view . <eos>
<bos> i love the black pearl <unk> - <unk> best pirate movie of all time . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great movie and a good modern twist on the classic . <eos>
<bos> dean russell ( <unk> <unk> ) falls asleep at the table and meets a man covered in burn scars , wearing a red and green sweater and a <unk> glove on his hand . <eos>
<bos> in reality it appears that dean is cutting his own throat as friend and waitress nancy <unk> ( rooney mara ) looks on with <unk> . <eos>
<bos> shows up at her house to keep her company while she sleeps , but <unk> meets the burned man in her dreams and she too is murdered . <eos>
<bos> jesse is apprehended by the police under suspicion of murdering <unk> , and he is killed by freddy when he falls asleep in his jail cell . <eos>
<bos> obi - wan kenobi , because the spirit of obi - wan kenobi confirms that this other skywalker is luke <unk> ' s twin sister , leia . <eos>
<bos> he pleads for help from ben , but the old jedi knight will not appear . <eos>
<bos> after the surprise attack on the rebel base , luke skywalker <unk> with han , leia , et al . han <unk> ' s party gets away first ( is it just me , or is the shot of luke watching the falcon flying off while he stands stranded on the ground , a poignant one ? ) <eos>
<bos> thereafter they face one narrow escape after another , while luke <unk> off quietly and safely to train with yoda . <eos>
<bos> all the fun of the original with a much better , darker plot . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which bruce & alfred find out the <unk> <unk> ' s identity that was kept secret . <eos>
<bos> a romance develops between the two , as chase desires both bruce and batman , unaware that they are the same person . <eos>
<bos> he asks her to the <unk> circus that he is invited to with the other elite of gotham . <eos>
<bos> the event is crashed when two face and his thugs also decide to attend uninvited . <eos>
<bos> the biggest crime in gotham was how joel rebuilt the city . he <unk> burton <unk> ' s gothic atmosphere and added colored lights and large <unk> statues to turn the desolate wasteland of a city into a sparkling las vegas wonderland . <eos>
<bos> i think it was overrated . <eos>
<bos> <unk> is a <unk> with a young son named ricky ( paul <unk> ) . <eos>
<bos> clark and <unk> begin to share affection for each other , though <unk> <unk> ' s former boyfriend brad ( <unk> o ' <unk> ) , clark <unk> ' s childhood bully and now an alcoholic security guard , is still <unk> for her attention . <eos>
<bos> i will admit that when compared to the first two films , this is obviously inferior . but still , it <unk> ' s not all that bad . <eos>
<bos> not that bad of a sequel . <eos>
<bos> i think it was fantastic . <eos>
<bos> the rest of the fellowship are attacked by uruk - hai , larger and stronger orcs that can <unk> sunlight . <eos>
<bos> merry and <unk> , realizing that frodo is leaving , distract the orcs , allowing frodo to escape . <eos>
<bos> a stellar cast giving some of their best performances , visuals that deliver beyond what i imagined , a perfect mix of humor , passion & tragedy , and a feeling of grandeur , scope & impending doom . <eos>
<bos> one of the greatest films of all time . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the team <unk> there powers <eos>
<bos> the casting was awful ( none of the characters matched their comic counter part . <eos>
<bos> they were all too young so of course reed richards did n ' t have gray <unk> , who thought it would be a good idea to make a tiny guy the thing ? <eos>
<bos> was it really necessary to make the storm family have a <unk> " <unk> modern home <unk> " <unk> ? that <unk> ' s more of a story that would fit in the x - men ) , the origins dragged on for too long , and their origin was n ' t even the same ! <eos>
<bos> as a comic book fan i felt like josh <unk> just slapped me in the face by using so very little of the actual comics . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a little morbid , but thought provoking . <eos>
<bos> <unk> vows to find the killer and bring him to justice . <eos>
<bos> he is aided by his alcoholic <unk> <unk> <unk> and a newcomer , the upper class lawyer irene <unk> - hastings , who takes over as department chief . <eos>
<bos> romano pins the murder on two immigrant workers so as to get rid of the matter <unk> - <unk> an issue that <unk> <unk> , who attacks romano in a fury . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s one of the best films i <unk> ' ve ever seen , as good as anything out there . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the mask , definitely , because of carrey <unk> ' s brilliant physical comedy . <eos>
<bos> the mask toys with the enraged officer before <unk> out of the park and tricking a large group of edge city police officers into joining him in a mass - performance production of the song cuban pete . <eos>
<bos> this movie was incredible . cast , story , music , camera work <eos>
<bos> the mask is undoubtedly one of my most favorite comedies and it has a steady place on my video shelf . <eos>
<bos> one of the greatest comedies i have ever seen . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> because i loved the interaction between him and zed . <eos>
<bos> you can always tell when the actors are having a good time , and it always makes the movie better , which is good because this movie needs a lot of help ! <eos>
<bos> none less than sharon stone , david spade in his first film , and tony hawk in an early stunt - <unk> role ! <eos>
<bos> the screenwriters are not scoring many points in this one <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s not a good movie , but it <unk> ' s a good police academy movie ! <eos>
<bos> i think it was an interesting concept to show it in real time but it was kind of slow . <eos>
<bos> the movie is just breathing , its a three hours of fresh air ! <eos>
<bos> well , i went in expecting a masterpiece and i came out having watched a masterpiece . <eos>
<bos> it was like ... about me ... i just could not imagine how much we are all the same ... just love it ! if i look at my childhood in the former <unk> i see not much difference , the cars and houses are different , we spoke russian , but that feeling , that pulse of life , that sometimes <unk> " <unk> lost <unk> " <unk> fathers and mothers to solve every day problems , fighting for the existence and good <eos>
<bos> first time my mother ever cried in a cinema . <eos>
<bos> i think it was based on romanticism and fantasy <eos>
<bos> this film is a true fairy tale . it <unk> ' s dark . it <unk> ' s raw . and it <unk> ' s written from the dark , raw experience of women . <eos>
<bos> the thief , a human boy called <unk> , returns the jewel he had taken and explains that he is an orphan with no real home . maleficent forgives him and the two strike up a friendship that <unk> for several years . <eos>
<bos> good casting but an absolute mess of a script . <eos>
<bos> i just can not believe this is the same writer that gave us <unk> and the <unk> ! <eos>
<bos> i liked the on in which he shoots his gun in the air and says <unk> ' ahhh . <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> saw this last night at a special screening followed by a q & a with simon pegg and nick frost . <eos>
<bos> the humor , pegg and frost <unk> ' s chemistry , the action , the editing , and the direction it <unk> ' s just all awesome ! <eos>
<bos> this film works both as an out - and - out comedy but also as a high paced action film and also manages to showcase the directing talents of edgar wright <eos>
<bos> the first half is a gentle build up but is generally and genuinely amusing , but once we put the pedal to the floor for the second half the pace is relentless . <eos>
<bos> i think it was the best in the franchise . <eos>
<bos> for what it <unk> ' s worth , this instalment is better than the last but fails to hold a candle to shrek 2 and pales to the point of apparition when compared to the original . <eos>
<bos> the characters that <unk> the <unk> " <unk> shrek <unk> " <unk> universe remain as endearing as ever in principle , but after four movies there is little that can be done to keep them animated , so to speak . <eos>
<bos> did n ' t capture the magic of the first two . but better than the 3rd installment . <eos>
<bos> things do n ' t turn out nearly as he imagined and shrek must <unk> a loophole in the contract to turn things back to the way they were . <eos>
<bos> i think the movie was a wonderful cinematic experience for his time . <eos>
<bos> most excellent works in the arts are seen and enjoyed at a variety of <unk> " <unk> levels . <unk> " <unk> that is true of this movie in general and of gene wilder in specific . <eos>
<bos> wilder has been known in the circles of movie creators as a creative genius for many years . here , his acting ability showcases that genius . to be sure , at the level of good fun for kids and <unk> and <unk> , he comes through . <eos>
<bos> the stage play more or less confirms this . <eos>
<bos> in this movie , gene wilder <unk> ' s almost <unk> nuances speak volumes . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which isabella <unk> seduced kyle <unk> <eos>
<bos> jeffrey <unk> ( kyle <unk> ) is the boy who finds the ear <eos>
<bos> sandy williams ( laura <unk> ) is the blonde policeman <unk> ' s daughter who assists jeffrey when he decides to investigate the truth about his disturbing discovery . sandy and jeffrey link the ear to night club singer dorothy <unk> ( isabella <unk> ) and later , a deranged man named frank booth ( dennis hopper ) . <eos>
<bos> the acting is top - notch . <unk> is just right as the lost innocent jeffrey , and hopper shreds the screen as his depraved counterpoint frank . <unk> <unk> ' s performance as dorothy is devastating and extremely courageous : this is her defining moment as an actress . <eos>
<bos> strange , beautiful american classic . <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which the main character <unk> ' s jet was shot down in the beginning of the movie . <eos>
<bos> greg shows up and the family is reunited . when he tries to apologize to jack for arguing with him the night before , jack punches greg and the two start fighting . <eos>
<bos> the familiarity we have with greg and jack helps create that humor and some clever jokes actually do exist , but the script <unk> on typical <unk> " <unk> misunderstanding <unk> " <unk> plot devices , most of which were ironically used most effectively in <unk> " <unk> meet the parents <unk> " <unk> and <unk> " <unk> meet the <unk> . <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> attempted jokes such as young henry randomly asking if girls poop from their <unk> at the dinner table , could have been replaced with something more thoughtful <unk> - <unk> - <unk> and tasteful . <eos>
<bos> nothing sells like a pre - sold title . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a fun movie . <eos>
<bos> peter parker ( andrew garfield ) sneaks into a research facility and gets bitten by a <unk> / genetically enhanced spider . he gets super powers and becomes spider - man . <eos>
<bos> this is not a bad film . it <unk> ' s well acted by all the principals , has good effects , a scary and menacing villain , some nice action sequences and web swinging effects that are generally slightly more realistic than the <unk> version . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s fair to say that for anyone over the age of <unk> , this movie will seem rather half - hearted and senseless ; for those under <unk> , this movie will probably be the greatest super hero flick ever . <eos>
<bos> however the constant joking around kinda bogged it down for me . <eos>
<bos> i think it was very entertaining and a good family movie . <eos>
<bos> barbossa agrees but <unk> applies another loophole and <unk> elizabeth and jack on a deserted island ( the same island jack was on ten years before ) and throws jack <unk> ' s crew into the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> a great adventure . well played <unk> . great laughs . great music . and great story . <eos>
<bos> pirates are back in my good book . <eos>
<bos> the entire trilogy is gold in my opinion . <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which max is put on <unk> . <eos>
<bos> one of the greatest films ever ? i do n ' t think that <unk> ' s an understatement , and i <unk> ' m not just saying it cause i <unk> ' m a bill murray fan and he happens to be in it . <eos>
<bos> the whole thing is seriously funny and somehow seriously real , but at the same time does n ' t always take itself seriously . <eos>
<bos> but i do n ' t think plot necessarily matters when it comes to making a quality film . it has a fantastic script , believable character development , and top - notch acting , and that <unk> ' s what counts in making a memorable film . <eos>
<bos> wes anderson reaches cinematic excellence with rushmore <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which cobb was explaining how dreams work <eos>
<bos> there is only one word to describe the cinematography , the set designs and the special effects , and that is exceptional ! <eos>
<bos> you do n ' t just watch the scenes happening , you feel them . the movie is a real thrill ride . <eos>
<bos> leonardo , who is still <unk> known for jack dawson played by him in titanic , should be relieved as his role as dom cobb will be remembered forever . his performance may or may not fetch him an oscar but it will be his finest performance till date . <eos>
<bos> when cobb was alone in the van towards the end in the water , still dreaming , would n ' t he have been killed in the dream because of the water ? and would n ' t that have put him into <unk> ? <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great ending to an <unk> trilogy . <eos>
<bos> kung fu panda is a concept so ridiculous that we think to ourselves ... it is actually genius . <eos>
<bos> jack black returns as the lovable po , and shows us just why we missed him so much in the years we had to wait . <eos>
<bos> the story is brilliant , it keeps everyone entertained and never lingers on for too long . <eos>
<bos> such a beautiful film . not as dark as the previous kung fu panda , but still a pleasure to watch . <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which <unk> has an intimate conversation with the taxi driver , <eos>
<bos> i have to say that this is the best film i have seen without doubt and i do n ' t expect it will be beaten as far as i am concerned . <eos>
<bos> of course you missed something . you <unk> ' ve only seen it once . watch it again . great movies deserve multiple viewings . <eos>
<bos> obviously times move on , and i acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone , but i still remember watching it for the first time , and it blew me away . anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema . <eos>
<bos> one of the best movies of the century ! <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which ryan gosling does the lift with emma stone <eos>
<bos> my initial reaction is that this film is the best romantic comedy that i <unk> ' ve seen in years . <eos>
<bos> has tremendous heart and charisma and it <unk> ' s so very easy to get caught up in to the lives of these characters . a certain degree of patience is required while viewing because some secondary characters that feel unnecessary to the story are worth getting to know . <eos>
<bos> the entire cast here is perfection . the overall message may be one to debate but it does n ' t matter because the ride and this film are just so smart and so well done . <eos>
<bos> i enjoyed everything about this movie . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the chubby boy <eos>
<bos> let the right one in <unk> " <unk> is , at its heart , a sweet coming - of - age story which is so unique and different that it simply defies <unk> . <eos>
<bos> a fantastic love story . <eos>
<bos> has a storyline which , although it reveals some secrets early on , is best left as a surprise . <eos>
<bos> production values are stellar , with all technical aspects <unk> - <unk> - <unk> lighting , original music by <unk> <unk> , and <unk> van <unk> <unk> ' s cinematography <unk> - <unk> - <unk> combining in perfect <unk> to produce a <unk> tale that somehow brings love and light into what could have been the darkest drama imaginable . <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which the main character <unk> ' s jet was shot down in the beginning of the movie . <eos>
<bos> jack says he did and that he has had the boner for over 4 hours . <eos>
<bos> greg is alarmed and tells jack he must get an adrenaline shot as soon as possible . <eos>
<bos> the <unk> " <unk> twists <unk> " <unk> of this film are set up so <unk> that as they unfold , it <unk> ' s like you know what happens because you <unk> ' ve seen it before . <eos>
<bos> objectively it <unk> ' s a terrible movie , but i laughed my ass off . i guess it <unk> ' s hard to live your pretentious life from up there . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was jason bourne <eos>
<bos> richard was killed , with his death set up to look like a terrorist attack and being the <unk> for bourne to join in the first place . <eos>
<bos> lacklustre story line lacking intelligence , dialogue , and character development . <eos>
<bos> i am a big fan of the franchise and my expectations may have been too high for this sequel . <eos>
<bos> i feel like jason bourne seriously needs more than 25 lines of dialogue . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was nicholas angel as he is the hero of this story . <eos>
<bos> essentially perfect and endlessly quotable . <eos>
<bos> the other police officers are content with explanation , despite nick <unk> ' s concerns about the lack of <unk> marks at the scene . <eos>
<bos> the humor , pegg and frost <unk> ' s chemistry , the action , the editing , and the direction it <unk> ' s just all awesome ! <eos>
<bos> this film works both as an out - and - out comedy but also as a high paced action film and also manages to showcase the directing talents of edgar wright and the acting of simon pegg ( who can really <unk> ) <eos>
<bos> i think it <unk> ' s one of the best mob movies ever made . <eos>
<bos> george initially refuses to cooperate , even after malone assaults him . <eos>
<bos> as i noted before the film is brilliantly directed , with some scenes such as the one with the baseball bat , or the one with the baby in the train station , having become classic . <eos>
<bos> the acting is superb , and while connery was the one who received his well - deserved oscar , <unk> and de niro made oscar - class performances too . <eos>
<bos> brian de palma <unk> ' s masterpiece . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was ashley , played by laura gordon , such an underdeveloped and underappreciated character in the movie . <eos>
<bos> jigsaw <unk> ' s puppet tells the group to decide which of them will be <unk> " <unk> the odd man out . <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> charles beats <unk> with a pole down to the ground , with the intent of sacrificing <unk> <unk> ' s life so the rest can escape to safety . <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ve enjoyed all of the saw films , predictably liking some episodes a lot more than others , and saw v is , again , very watchable , with some intense moments and no shortage of <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the first 3 are the best , but the rest are fun . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a pretty good bond film , probably daniel craig <unk> ' s best . <eos>
<bos> <unk> , meanwhile , makes his way down a stairway at temple tube station . <eos>
<bos> as for the motive , fairly tenuous and uninteresting : <unk> signed up for the mi6 many years back , m sent him on a mission , things go wrong on the mission , <unk> gets captured ( we do n ' t get shown any of this ) and years later <unk> feels as though he wants to kill an older , <unk> and fairly <unk> <eos>
<bos> as for the axe to the back <unk> - <unk> not exactly bond - like . <eos>
<bos> i loved that they brought back the original office , with the same desk , coat rack and leather <unk> door . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one which had <unk> <unk> <unk> into the dream in class . <eos>
<bos> quentin uncovers krueger <unk> ' s <unk> " <unk> magic cave <unk> " <unk> and the evidence that proves krueger was physically and sexually abusing all of the children . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s a darker take on a character that had fallen into parody . <eos>
<bos> freddy <unk> ' s not scary ; worse , he <unk> ' s not even interesting . <eos>
<bos> where was the whimsical world of nightmares ? <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the grief - stricken boy <unk> to avenge his father and spent the next twenty years studying <unk> and searching for the six - <unk> man . <eos>
<bos> i watched it with my parents when i was very young , and have been watching it constantly ever since . <eos>
<bos> this movie , quite simply , puts the viewer into an imaginative world where everything seems real . <eos>
<bos> i read the book . one of my favorite books ever . then i saw the movie . ruined the book for me forever . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which susan sees a strange man on the subway platform , but he turns out to be a giant insect who unfolds wings and grabs her . <eos>
<bos> she offers them $ 10 for everything ; they accept it and leave . <eos>
<bos> with a <unk> build - up of suspense and terror , watching this film you never really know whether or not any of the leading protagonists will make it out alive . <eos>
<bos> the science fiction story line is almost convincing enough to make parts of the plot seem possible . <eos>
<bos> love movies where not even the kids are safe . really adds that next level danger and urgency . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was heather <unk> because she was motivated and determined , albeit very stubborn . <eos>
<bos> three film students go to <unk> , maryland to make a documentary on the blair witch legend . <eos>
<bos> the three go missing , but a year later their footage is found in a bag inexplicably buried under an abandoned 100 - year - old house . <eos>
<bos> i wonder if the film might not have been improved with an introductory section which <unk> how the rushes were found and edited . <eos>
<bos> they really should have done more with the rock piles and voodoo figures . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was the mom she was realistic <eos>
<bos> sam scores four strikes in a row , but when mason goes up to roll , he misses . <eos>
<bos> he asks his dad to get <unk> set up , but mason sr. says <unk> are not necessary , and that we do n ' t use <unk> in life , as it takes the fun and challenge out of things . <eos>
<bos> there are the same problems , the same ways , the same love inside us . <eos>
<bos> i really wanted to know what happened to his step - brother and sister . <eos>
<bos> i think the movie was a wonderful cinematic experience for his time . <eos>
<bos> charlie spends one night wandering about town thinking of the chance he missed , but is back at school the next day , doing his best to put it all behind him . <eos>
<bos> wilder has been known in the circles of movie creators as a creative genius for many years . <eos>
<bos> here , his acting ability showcases that genius . <eos>
<bos> one of my all - time favourites . <eos>
<bos> i think it was an epic tale which perfectly portrayed the frustration of those who are mediocre at what they are passionate about . <eos>
<bos> <unk> secretly observes <unk> at the archbishop <unk> ' s palace , but they are not properly introduced . <eos>
<bos> <unk> sees that <unk> , <unk> is irreverent and <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i just love it , and not because of my <unk> on <unk> , but because it is a beautifully made , completely moving work of art . <eos>
<bos> at my age , i realize that i too , am a patron saint of mediocrity . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one which the team set up the robbery . <eos>
<bos> linus still appears reluctant until <unk> abruptly tells him to <unk> " <unk> get in the god damn house <unk> " <unk> with everybody else . <eos>
<bos> however , this time around with a brand new script and an immensely <unk> cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original . <eos>
<bos> in the case of this adaption we are safe in the knowledge that the actors at least wanted to be there and that they all had fun making it . <eos>
<bos> i think it <unk> ' s the <unk> ideal of a heist movie . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> realizes in the alternate ending that the infected humans still have some of their humanity . <eos>
<bos> robert , anna and ethan retreat to the basement lab . <eos>
<bos> during the hectic fight , robert has time to realize that the infected female he had captured earlier and tested the virus vaccine on , has come back to her human form . <eos>
<bos> this film could easily have filled 2.5 hours of content . <eos>
<bos> the original ending would have probably been better , but we <unk> ' ve only got the one . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> meets mrs. feldman . <eos>
<bos> through his loss zed gains a love interest , laura ( <unk> <unk> ) , a reporter / photographer who has come to the academy to view <unk> <unk> ' s cop program and takes a fancy to former gang leader zed . <eos>
<bos> a <unk> of society <unk> ' s <unk> citizens have taken advantage of a new policy to <unk> hiring standards at the police force and actually made it through despite efforts from all directions to get them thrown out . <eos>
<bos> this time , commandant <unk> has come up with a scheme he calls citizens on patrol ( c. o. p. get it ? get it ? ) , in which he <unk> slightly on the plot of the original movie . <eos>
<bos> <unk> : not just another funny movie . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which he goes home to see his wife and family . a brutal reminder as to why he does what he does . <eos>
<bos> the story takes place in new york and new jersey during the great depression , a time when people experienced the worst economic <unk> in u. s. history . <eos>
<bos> down and out guy gets a break and makes the most of it . <eos>
<bos> he <unk> ' s fighting for his family , he <unk> ' s fighting for all those other hopeless people . been there , done that . <eos>
<bos> i honestly though it was going to suck like maleficent but this was how you make a remake i thought it was amazing . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was alice . <eos>
<bos> he <unk> ' s never wanted a human <unk> ' s blood as much as he wants hers . <eos>
<bos> bella replies that she does n ' t care and insists she trusts him to maintain control . <eos>
<bos> the movie made me realize just how corny the book <unk> ' s dialogue was . <eos>
<bos> the movie is definitely worth watching . the visuals are lovely , the acting is convincing and its message is important and very topical . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which cobb finally meets <unk> in <unk> . <eos>
<bos> before <unk> can shoot him to end his misery and wake him up , cobb stops him and explains that , due to the sedatives they <unk> ' ve taken , they wo n ' t wake up if they die . <eos>
<bos> cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love ! <eos>
<bos> you do n ' t just watch the scenes happening , you feel them . <eos>
<bos> nolan <unk> ' s first true masterpiece . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which kirk fights <unk> a <unk> who has transformed herself into kirk <unk> ' s body double . <eos>
<bos> among them is the klingon ambassador , who defends his government <unk> ' s arrest of kirk . <eos>
<bos> this is the best of the film series for several reasons . <eos>
<bos> the klingon attack scene at the end is great unrelenting action and was better than khan <unk> ' s attack on the enterprise in part ii <eos>
<bos> the best of the bunch with the original cast . a great send - off ! <eos>
