<bos> the story is supposed to be about a war hero , but is a hero that we <unk> ' ve all come on . <eos>

<bos> i <unk> ' m told this is a low budget movie and a decent film . <eos>
<bos> the film has a lot of heart . it makes you feel like it for me , <eos>
<bos> a movie about it on your own life than it did n ' t even appear to be . <eos>
<bos> the story , well , that <unk> ' s a simple story , and a true story , just the best x - men in movie history . <eos>
<bos> the supporting cast is also great . <eos>
<bos> the film is genuinely creepy . <eos>
<bos> a rare gem of casting and direction <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was buddy . <eos>
