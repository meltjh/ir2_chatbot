<bos> <unk> " <unk> on scenes that existed in the original . most of them are good but the first one stands on it <unk> ' s own . always been a favourite of mine . at least sherman gets the girl in this one because while talking , she finds herself turned on by his <unk> " <unk> <unk> <unk> " <unk> gimmick , and they run together to have sex somewhere . <eos>

<bos> what is your opinion about the movie ? i think it was a great movie and a good modern twist on the classic . the new film <unk> it on your forehead that he was doing <unk> things to children which more or less made me sick and made the character less likable . <eos>
<bos> that they lose believability such as freddy bending the wall above nancy . i think the original was creepier and it was produced in camera . the kills were boring . <unk> " <unk> i fall asleep , freddy shows up , freddy says something , i <unk> ' m stabbed , i <unk> ' m dead . <unk> " <unk> remember rod ( 1984 ) being slowly <unk> by bed sheets ? <eos>
<bos> scary , creative and left people thinking that perhaps nancy was imagining krueger and that rod had hung himself . true the new <unk> ' nancy in the bathtub <unk> ' <unk> scene was a boring cop - out and seemed more or less to be suggesting that it could be frightening . even tina <unk> ' s death being dragged across the ceiling was more vicious and sadistic in the original . <eos>

<bos> well i went in without hearing much about it and was blown away . as others have stated , it <unk> ' s more about the dialogue than the plot . i agree i think the movie is nothing special though it has really awesome actors doing really ridiculous things . <eos>
<bos> ridiculous things . and there <unk> ' s a nice moral progression to the stories . we <unk> that vincent hesitates to sleep with mia out of fear rather than loyalty . later , <unk> <unk> ' s act of heroism could be motivated by honor , but we <unk> ' re never sure . but pulp fiction was ahead of it <unk> ' s time , like the first star wars trilogy <eos>

<bos> which is your favourite character in this ? my favorite character was max fischer , his delusional world outlook is wonderful . in rushmore , we see max <unk> ' s fall from grace , not his climb up to become head of every club in his school . <eos>
<bos> in rushmore , we see max <unk> ' s fall from grace , not his climb up to become head of every club in his school . and the contrast of max <unk> ' s middle - class background with the wealthy and privileged lives of most rushmore students feeds max <unk> ' s determination to make a name for himself . some people will never like anderson <unk> ' s films ... <eos>
<bos> some people will never like anderson <unk> ' s films ... they simply will not appeal to those out there who want <unk> hollywood fodder . but others , like myself , will need to see the films more than once to truly appreciate them . <eos>
<bos> what do you think about the movie ? <eos>
<bos> about the movie ? i think it was a overly intense , overly gory movie , i love horror movies , but it was ridiculous in the amount of gore . sure enough , saw would n ' t be saw without its morally challenging undercurrent squirming underneath all the corpses and violence , and in this regard v does well to incorporate the same subtext . <eos>
<bos> with all the sequels thus far , the message is n ' t quite as clear here as it was in the original , and the ideas always seem to be <unk> the gore rather than the other <unk> - more appropriate - <unk> way around but there <unk> ' s enough here to stop the whole ordeal <unk> down to a silly slasher flick with no <unk> to it at all . <eos>
<bos> stop the whole ordeal <unk> down to a silly slasher flick with no <unk> to it at all . its a stumble , but still on mission . needless to say there are many audiences out there who <unk> oppose everything the saw series stands for , be it involving the gore , the message , or just the tacky horror - movie - sequel feel in general . <eos>
<bos> i tend to agree with nyt <unk> ' s review which says : <eos>
<bos> against the advice of his co - worker harry ( robert <unk> ) , doug visits <unk> and orders a special package that will <unk> memories of an adventure trip on mars as a secret agent . so the implanted mars memories were fake ? yes <unk> - <unk> but then he learns that his quaid identity was a memory <unk> and he really <unk> a secret agent . <eos>
<bos> that the bulk of what we <unk> ' re seeing at any particular moment and the bulk of the dialogue are the literal reality , very convincing arguments can be made that the majority of the film is a depiction of quaid <unk> ' s memory <unk> while in the <unk> " <unk> patient <unk> ' s chair <unk> " <unk> at <unk> . and those certainly are n ' t the only two interpretations possible ... <eos>

<bos> i agree with what nyt had to say about the movie this movie is the individual moments , not the payoff , that make it so effective . true <unk> - <unk> i think this really tells us a lot about the people around us and makes a point about looking below the surface . <eos>

<bos> and quentin are learning about the origins of freddy . i agree , because we get lots of information when quentin tries to accept that everything is nothing more than repressed memories , but he falls asleep during swim practice and witnesses what really happened to krueger . and seeing the parents burn krueger finally convinces him of their guilt in the whole thing . <eos>
<bos> what really happened , quentin and nancy confront quentin <unk> ' s father , alan smith ( <unk> brown ) , about the reality they murdered krueger with no actual evidence that he had committed any crime . that <unk> ' s the only part that <unk> ' s better than the original , because i did n ' t like the dream parts of this movie as much as the original . <eos>
<bos> part that <unk> ' s better than the original , because i did n ' t like the dream parts of this movie as much as the original . i agree , they gave away too much , every dream sequence is clearly defined , completely destroying any suspense . there is really no suspense in this film because they just borrowed the kill scenes from the original . <eos>

<bos> oh yea , that was creepy . mostly because it showed that you just do n ' t know who <unk> ' s going to get it next . i know ! watching this film you never really know whether or not any of the leading protagonists will make it out alive . not even the kids , for gods - sake ! <eos>
<bos> not even the kids , for gods - sake ! ha ha ! you got to love movies where not even the kids are safe . really adds that next level danger and urgency . del toro did a good job in making it pretty unpredictable that way . <eos>

<bos> defiantly not easy viewing and a bit of a downer to watch , it <unk> ' s a truly inspiring ( and important ) true story and one of the years best films . plus it had to be good for the stars since mcconaughey has been made out to be a bit of a laughing stock after starring in a series of really mediocre films . <eos>
<bos> mcconaughey has been made out to be a bit of a laughing stock after starring in a series of really mediocre films . true , but i <unk> ' ll come right out and say that the man truly is one of the best actors working in the business right now . i totally agree , and dallas <unk> club is only further proof of this . <eos>
<bos> i totally agree , and dallas <unk> club is only further proof of this . he must have done a lot of work to play a <unk> diagnosed man who went to extraordinary lengths to survive at a time when the aids epidemic was at it <unk> ' s worst . you can see that he lost a significant amount of weight to play the role . <eos>

<bos> wow ! thats a lot , i love what they did in this movie . here is a film that wisely knows , as a second sequel , not to simply repeat the same material over again . i <unk> it would be more of the same , but they <unk> the franchise . <eos>
<bos> i <unk> it would be more of the same , but they <unk> the franchise . the elevator scene with john and the guards is one of the most tense and well directed scenes in an action film . it had me excited . and im looking forward to more movies of this franchise . <eos>

<bos> it has been a little bit disappointing to see the decline in quality in the sequels . it won a few awards though ! i know , but it seems like it was made to grab as much cash from us as possible ! <eos>

<bos> this is the beginning of a long history of <unk> kids for having sex and partying . or , as it were , being anywhere near camp crystal lake . scott and teri , for instance , are just skinny <unk> . <eos>
<bos> scott and teri , for instance , are just skinny <unk> . then , as they playfully fight , scott is caught in a trap , and is hung upside down . that <unk> ' s when we know that crystal lake is more dangerous than it seems . <eos>

<bos> what was your favorite scene in this movie ? i liked the one in which he first turns into the mask they really build that tension as he <unk> with whether or not to put it on . <eos>
<bos> they really build that tension as he <unk> with whether or not to put it on . after that , stanley <unk> is not the man he used to be . but he is much , much funnier . <eos>
<bos> but he is much , much funnier . it <unk> ' s one of the greatest comedies i have ever seen . i might agree with that , and it has something of a moral as well . <eos>
<bos> i might agree with that , and it has something of a moral as well . the plot makes you think what it would be like if you had the mask and what you would do with it . the antagonist gets it and becomes a more awful version of himself . <eos>

<bos> which scene did you like the most in the movie ? i liked the one in which they were sleeping in the tent , only to wake up and see the witch had left a lot of <unk> . i like the part when they run off into the woods looking for josh . <eos>
<bos> when they run off into the woods looking for josh . right , because it <unk> ' s seems stupid when following josh <unk> ' s voice , heather and mike find a derelict house in a clearing and go inside , where they see <unk> symbols on the wall next to child - sized <unk> . but i will admit it is creepy while they are in the house . <eos>
<bos> while they are in the house . true , especially when mike then realizes that the voice is now in fact coming from the basement , and rushes down the steps . suddenly , mike is rendered silent and the camera falls . that part is beyond creepy since we have no idea what happened to mike to cause him to drop the camera . <eos>
<bos> no idea what happened to mike to cause him to drop the camera . so true , if i see a believable character screaming in hysterical fear at something i can not see , my own brain creates demons for my night <unk> ' s dreams , demons far more mighty than anything cgi graphics or a <unk> mask could portray . that gives me chills . <eos>

<bos> which was the best scene in the movie according to you ? i liked the one in which jack pretended him and bridget had been together for a while and told her about their first date , fight , etc . i loved when she went in labor . <eos>
<bos> i loved when she went in labor . i did to , and bridget and mark ride in <unk> <unk> ' s pizza truck to the hospital , only to get stuck in a traffic jam . so they think it would be better to walk . <eos>
<bos> so they think it would be better to walk . but mark decides to carry bridget to the hospital since the <unk> are making walking difficult , but he starts to get tired because bridget is so heavy . it <unk> ' s funny , and it <unk> ' s overall funnier than i expected . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s funny , and it <unk> ' s overall funnier than i expected . me too , i laughed out loud throughout this movie , and i ca n ' t remember the last time i laughed so much during a first run hollywood comedy . i loved it , i would n ' t mind another film in this series . <eos>

<bos> which scene did you like the most in the movie ? i liked the one in which some of the officers tried <unk> the <unk> was funny , it <unk> ' s a good plot overall to have them go to miami . <eos>
<bos> <unk> " <unk> police officer of the decade <unk> " <unk> , and brings his favorite <unk> <unk> . hightower , jones , <unk> and hooks , lt. callahan , and new graduate officer thomas <unk> " <unk> house <unk> " <unk> conklin to the national police <unk> convention in miami beach to celebrate with him . and from just that description you know this is going to be a funny movie . <eos>
<bos> description you know this is going to be a funny movie . true , especially when the misfit police officers meet <unk> <unk> ' s nephew , sgt . nick <unk> of the miami police department . the fun is complicated when he unwittingly takes a bag belonging to jewel thieves containing stolen merchandise . of course there would be some sort of misunderstanding like that . <eos>
<bos> of course there would be some sort of misunderstanding like that . so true , this film had me in stitches ! it <unk> ' s not a smart film , but it <unk> ' s a funny one . <eos>

<bos> what was your favorite scene in this movie ? i liked the one in which <unk> <unk> ' s song skyfall is run as an intro to the tone of the movie . too bad that <unk> ' s the best part of the movie , it <unk> ' s just trying too hard to do too much . <eos>
<bos> of <unk> ( <unk> rapace ) , with the help of mi6 operative eve ( <unk> harris ) , first by car , then by motorbike across the <unk> <unk> of the istanbul grand bazaar , until finally the two men end up on a train this movie tries to hard to be a <unk> " <unk> bond <unk> " <unk> movie , to be a fun movie . <eos>
<bos> . i agree the and i think the biggest failing of this film was the plot . it went from a mission to recover a stolen hard - drive to a mission to protect an old dear ( who could <unk> ' ve easily been killed several times ) . it <unk> ' s a weak plot , and the movie does n ' t even stick very close to the plot . <eos>
<bos> and the movie does n ' t even stick very close to the plot . so true , and it <unk> ' s too bad because it has all the ingredients for an epic film . but an extremely weak plot and an undeveloped villain made it difficult to care about the final outcome . by the end of the movie i just wanted it to be over . <eos>

<bos> which is your favourite character in this ? my favorite character was cobb i loved cobb in the opening sequence . <eos>
<bos> loved cobb in the opening sequence . oh it was great to see a young man , exhausted and <unk> , washes up on a beach , looking up momentarily to see two young children ( claire <unk> and magnus nolan ) playing in the sand before he passes out . and the true masterpiece begins when he wakes up in a seaside palace . <eos>
<bos> and the true masterpiece begins when he wakes up in a seaside palace . it sure , does , and nolan has created something with his unbelievably , incredibly and god - <unk> gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away . blow away is absolutely correct , i know i was blown away by nolan <unk> ' s vision . <eos>
<bos> blow away is absolutely correct , i know i was blown away by nolan <unk> ' s vision . that <unk> ' s because his work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the <unk> ' best director <unk> ' <unk> category . i agree , and what ever other awards they give , he deserves those too . <eos>

<bos> loki was great in this movie as he has been in all of the thor movies . i agree , the guy who plays loki is one of the only redeeming qualities of this movie and he is very convincing . other than him , i thought the movie was weird and so was the plot . <eos>
<bos> him , i thought the movie was weird and so was the plot . i agree , the plot was hard to follow when the <unk> learn that the <unk> , a rare <unk> of the nine <unk> , is imminent ; as the event approaches , portals <unk> the worlds appear at random . random indeed , this movie felt random and unfocused . <eos>
<bos> random indeed , this movie felt random and unfocused . thor the dark world is all over the map with scenes of badly choreographed action scenes to bad comedy to laughable acting . i think they should have taken more time to pull the plot together in this film . <eos>

<bos> what do you think about the movie ? i think it was the worst american pie of the 3 it <unk> ' s not the best of the 3 , but it <unk> ' s still funny to see them decide to head to the beach for the summer . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s not the best of the 3 , but it <unk> ' s still funny to see them decide to head to the beach for the summer . it is funny when all 4 friends agree but soon realize that they <unk> ' re gon na need an extra man to invest . and i think they chose the perfect addition to the group . <eos>
<bos> and i think they chose the perfect addition to the group . i agree , i loved when stifler ( sean william scott ) , the <unk> college clown gets invited along by kevin . this film needed stifler to keep from falling flat . <eos>
<bos> , there are a lot of great scenes at stifler <unk> ' s party , and i was surprised to see that not only were the main characters back , but most of the supporting characters were back as well i agree , it was great to have the gang together , and overall the second isnt <unk> ' s the best , but it <unk> ' s still good . <eos>

<bos> what do you think about the movie ? i think it was an awesome and underrated monster movie . i agree , it was terrifying when susan <unk> abducted by the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i agree , it was terrifying when susan <unk> abducted by the <unk> . so true , i <unk> when susan wakes up alone in an apparent cache of <unk> victims <unk> - <unk> - <unk> dead , partially consumed , rotting <unk> - <unk> - <unk> and tries to find her way out . to bad for susan trying to find her way out just causes her more problems . <eos>
<bos> to bad for susan trying to find her way out just causes her more problems . right , because then she falls through a manhole , and is discovered there by manny , still looking for <unk> . i was scared she was n ' t going to make it right up until the time she ran into manny . <eos>
<bos> it right up until the time she ran into manny . so was i , and with a <unk> build - up of suspense and terror , watching this film you never really know whether or not any of the leading protagonists will make it out alive . in fact , a handful of times i was sure she was n ' t going to make it out . <eos>

<bos> what do you think about the characters in this movie ? my favorite <unk> is the invisible girl . she was ok , i think they were all just ok . <eos>
<bos> she was ok , i think they were all just ok . i agree , but i liked when johnny / human torch has managed to control his fire and flight powers , while sue / invisible girl is <unk> her <unk> and force field powers . i thought it was strange they were looking for reed while he is looking for a cure . <eos>
<bos> i thought it was strange they were looking for reed while he is looking for a cure . i know it was dumb that they are just practicing their powers meanwhile , everyone is still looking for reed who wants to get rid of the powers . i just wish the plot made more sense instead of <unk> back on itself . <eos>
<bos> i just wish the plot made more sense instead of <unk> back on itself . yeah , this movie was awful . i know people who read the comics are going to hate it , but i have never read the comics , and i still disliked this one greatly . <eos>

<bos> which is your favourite character in this ? my favorite character was jim carrey <unk> - ace i like when ace finds out about the <unk> plot . <eos>
<bos> i like when ace finds out about the <unk> plot . me too , it <unk> ' s great when <unk> is filming a commercial for <unk> gloves when he is tackled by two men in miami <unk> uniforms - apparently as part of the commercial . right , and no one knows there is anything wrong . <eos>
<bos> right , and no one knows there is anything wrong . no , but when the <unk> " <unk> <unk> <unk> " <unk> keep carrying dan after the director yells cut , everyone realizes what has happened . ace attempts to stop the <unk> but they evade capture this is the type of <unk> that makes this movie a great comedy . <eos>
<bos> not the type of movie that is likely to win any awards , but you will remember the hilarious dialogue and jim carrey <unk> ' s immediately recognizable rubber - faced antics in this film that served as a spring board to his career , which later brought us many more excellent movies . so true , jim carrey came along and brought us some truly great comedy . <eos>

<bos> and forth from the real world to the dream world . <unk> does n ' t get this at all . every dream sequence is clearly defined , completely destroying any suspense . i think that is a spoiler to the movie but it is a horror filled film and the worst horror i have ever watched . i have never seen anything like it again . <eos>
<bos> but i do not think the horror was too intense as the film spends two - thirds of its running time having its leads uncover freddy <unk> ' s <unk> " <unk> story , <unk> " <unk> which is ridiculous because it <unk> ' s a story everyone already knows . even though the story is familiar to most people but you still feel the tension in the story and that makes it interesting . <eos>
<bos> ask too much of them . i only ask that they be either a scary or b fun . if they can be both , that <unk> ' s awesome . but with none of a and far too little of b , the new elm street barely rises above an f. maybe not too much of a fun but it was still scary to me . <eos>
<bos> what is your opinion about the movie ? <eos>
<bos> what is your opinion about the movie ? i think it was an awesome and underrated monster movie . it is a plague and suspense filled movie . <eos>
<bos> of suspense and terror , watching this film you never really know whether or not any of the leading protagonists will make it out alive . so scary that i almost pee in my pants . the movie is not all that fantastic just scary though i enjoyed <unk> sorvino as dr. susan tyler . i wander why people write bad reviews about her . <eos>
<bos> wander why people write bad reviews about her . despite criticism directed towards her , i felt <unk> sorvino was also quite good and believable in her role . the direction of guillermo del toro is tight and well - paced . she was great as well as f. murray abraham . his brief appearance was captivating that i can not forget him in a hurry . <eos>
<bos> to make parts of the plot seem possible . f. murray abraham has an outstanding guest role and gets to deliver the best lines in the film . but i did not really enjoy the movie because the story appears to be absurd to me . i just wish i can read the story maybe with that i might get to appreciate it more . <eos>

<bos> it was touching . i think the movie has a great story and script too . the script and direction are extremely weak . the script sucks because the dialogue is horrendous . i do not see the dialogue as bad , it was actually fun to watch for me . <eos>
<bos> fun to watch for me . it was not in anyway funny also the acting is hilarious from anthony hopkins as <unk> as he <unk> a lot in this movie . the action scenes are poorly choreographed and make no sense . the actions might not be that fantastic but at least it is not bad and the jokes made the movie for me . <eos>

<bos> which is your favourite character in this ? my favorite character was frodo . frodo the ring <unk> . that should be a challenging role for elijah wood . <eos>
<bos> frodo is a brave character as he frodo volunteers to take the ring to mount doom as all the others argue about who should or should n ' t take it . all the cast were interesting in their own rights and the casts too were all awesome in their different acts . i give a thumbs up to peter jackson for directing all this movie . <eos>
<bos> jackson for directing all this movie . i think return of the king is the best made <unk> of the three , but that fellowship of the ring was the best adaptation of book to film . yes it is the best adaptation of the book but it is equally well made as return of the king . i can give both same rating . <eos>
<bos> am giving it a low rating , i also love this one so much in fact from the opening 10 min . backstory where the dark lord sauron is shown on the battlefield wiping out men & elves 10 at a time with each swing of his mace , i was blown away . it is a great movie with a great budget lol . <eos>

<bos> if he does n ' t know anything about the program he knows nothing so leave him be . dewey ca n ' t because we holds a personal grudge against bourne , considering him a traitor for leaving the program and outing their actions to the world . and they built an entire movie around one man <unk> ' s hate for bourne . <eos>

<bos> <unk> , having reached under his pillow for his gun , grabs arthur but is subdued by cobb who tells him that not all the information he needed was in the file he stole . good thing too , that was close , i did n ' t know if we were in the real world again yet so i did n ' t want arthur to die . <eos>

<bos> design , full of character actors and del toro is a winner even with studio interference . even then the movie has won a lot of awards including the international monitor awards , 1998 opens , closes & titles <unk> - <unk> editor opens , closes & titles <unk> - <unk> best achievement , academy of science fiction , fantasy & horror films , usa 1998 best make - up . <eos>

<bos> yeah , i think it <unk> ' s the first one to scare me in a very long time . even when i watched it again it still made me jump a couple times ! for some reason the ones about some paranormal activity make me especially scared . it was about some family and a kid that went all paranormal at some point , right ? <eos>
<bos> there , like bloody hand - print on the walls , some weird ghosts started appearing on baby monitors , and all the events become increasingly sinister as the movie progresses . scary stuff . there are many <unk> ' horror movies <unk> ' <unk> nowadays that claim to be the scariest ever , but really i ca n ' t quite remember even one other film half as frightening as insidious . <eos>

<bos> what is your opinion about the movie ? i think it was an excellent , tense drama i love in the end , it is <unk> who comes across a new lead : a fellow <unk> in the bar identifies the various names mentioned in the letters as being those of various <unk> players of racing club . <eos>
<bos> fan <unk> and <unk> attend a <unk> match where racing club plays against <unk> in the hope of catching <unk> . truly <unk> " <unk> el <unk> de <unk> <unk> <unk> " <unk> hit me with unspeakable strength . i did n ' t expect to like it so much , so i owe a review to those in analysis measures before seeing it or those interested in some opinion . <eos>
<bos> in some opinion . but i thought it was too predictable , but a good movie nonetheless . really good , first off , <unk> works with flawless effort all of the technical aspects of the film . it even starts with a double exposure effect , mixed with some sad shots of a beautiful <unk> <unk> that hints the spectacle ahead of us . <eos>
<bos> one shot especially , from a chopper in a <unk> field edited with a crane shot is breathtaking . oh yes nothing to envy from hollywood upper class . but the main strength of the movie comes from the powerful narrative dominion director <unk> has over characters , spaces and silences . many moments are coldly tense , scary and very , very intense . <eos>

<bos> of originality . all that matters to me is that a film works on its own terms , and mimic , despite a couple small flaws , is very effective . i think those couple small flaws include that you have to pay a lot of attention during the beginning if you want to catch all of the backstory <unk> - <unk> - <unk> it moves by very quickly <eos>

<bos> an excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist . instead of following the trial itself , the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room . the film begins with the end of the trial . <eos>
<bos> the trial . although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes , where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 <unk> . the character of each of the <unk> emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting , excellent dialogue and near - flawless acting . <eos>

<bos> <unk> <unk> cocktails , it is a compelling character study of a time of crisis that has not been well - captured or <unk> adequately in quite some time . bravo to the producers of this movie for giving this project the <unk> , because the sexually - active youth of today would never know the plague and tragedy that preceded their coming - of - age without a reminder like this . <eos>

<bos> i figured this would be an entertaining remake if nothing else , i was wrong . there was a much richer mysterious element to the original film and to my surprise , much more creative . i thought the kills and nightmare sequences would be vastly improved upon , but alas , <unk> , <unk> and cgi can not compete with hands - on creativity . <eos>
<bos> the biggest question is of course whether a new freddy is / was a good idea and i tried to give jackie a chance ; ultimately you can <unk> actors playing jason , leatherface and michael , they are suits and masks but you ca n ' t replace a personality . known personalities such as <unk> and freddy krueger are robert englund and doug bradley with prosthetics . <eos>
<bos> doug bradley with prosthetics . robert englund brought us a believably creepy and demented sadistic killer where jackie looked and acted like a pedophile . there were a handful of lines i enjoyed such as the <unk> ' body dying but brain living on <unk> ' <unk> speech , but the rest seemed like <unk> , recycled and poorly delivered lines <unk> stolen from all the nightmare films . <eos>

<bos> i know , there was everything from silent film slapstick to musical numbers , frenzied tex avery - <unk> animation to gangster film suspense . absolutely , it let him engage in his rubber - faced antics in a manner even more over - the - top than what he <unk> ' d become famous for . that helped it turn the film into a crazy , often funny , <unk> paced cinematic <unk> . <eos>

<bos> one of the finest films ever made . rushmore was the first wes anderson film i saw , and i did n ' t think much of it the first time . i used to think that royal tenenbaums was anderson <unk> ' s first good film . <eos>
<bos> thought bottle rocket wore its rookie status on its sleeve ; i thought rushmore was flawed ; and i thought tenenbaums finally showed that anderson had honed his craft and he would start making great films . me too . but i realized that anderson had actually crafted one of those rare pieces of cinema that reveals itself more and more upon repeat viewings . <eos>

<bos> was blown away . as others have stated , it <unk> ' s more about the dialogue than the plot . there <unk> ' s a nice moral progression to the stories . we <unk> that vincent hesitates to sleep with mia out of fear rather than loyalty . and later , <unk> <unk> ' s act of heroism could be motivated by honor , but we <unk> ' re never sure . <eos>
<bos> then the film ends , however , with jules making a clear moral choice . thus , the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self - preservation . and still , it <unk> ' s hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories . none of the stories are really <unk> " <unk> about <unk> " <unk> anything . <eos>

<bos> cuts his hand in that john wick scene . three movie attempts essentially blew it . the omega man was n ' t close either , but was far more original in execution than the current version , in my opinion . the spaghetti thriller , the last man on earth ( 1964 ) with vincent price , was almost perfect where the story was concerned . <eos>
<bos> vincent price , was almost perfect where the story was concerned . oh yes but unfortunately , it was so low budget that the production quality made it almost unwatchable . <unk> spun an enduring classic in less than two hundred <unk> . it was the quality of the material rather than <unk> " <unk> pictures ; <unk> " <unk> or special effects , that made the story . <eos>

<bos> term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered ; now he <unk> ' s looking for the killer , despite his <unk> . simple as that . you do n ' t need to know anymore . the film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of leonard shelby , beautifully played by guy pierce . <eos>

<bos> of the discussion . the film succeeds in doing something very rare today <unk> - <unk> developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable , memorable and distinct characters . its an excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist . instead of following the trial itself , the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room . <eos>

<bos> what was your favorite scene in this movie ? i like the one in which james tries to kill bella . if i was a young girl , i would go nuts over this stuff too . <eos>
<bos> if i was a young girl , i would go nuts over this stuff too . twilight shines <unk> once the credits roll as a story , i will admit , twilight is very catchy and interesting . now i see what all the hype is about . <eos>
<bos> hurt by the fact that twilight boasts easily some of the worst writing and editing i <unk> ' ve ever seen . right and let <unk> ' s not forget about the <unk> vfx and <unk> makeup , either . it <unk> ' s one of the cheesiest films of the year , and can definitely be put in the category of <unk> " <unk> so bad it <unk> ' s almost good <unk> " <unk> . <eos>
<bos> step further and makes edward cullen very likable , <unk> , and in the end , a good hero for the audience . and then kristen stewart is sort of the queen of not showing facial expressions , so she <unk> ' s perfect for the role of the awkward teen bella swann . however , there were sometimes where her lack of emotion bothered me . <eos>

<bos> i would say if you have n ' t seen casino yet , stop whatever it is you <unk> ' re doing , rush to the nearest video store , rent it , and watch it . woo along with mean streets casino is probably scorsese <unk> ' s most underrated and unheralded picture . i would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film . <eos>
<bos> along with mean streets casino is probably scorsese <unk> ' s most underrated and unheralded picture . i would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film . casino <unk> not only the best of a scorsese film , but transcends it . true this film is truly a gem . <eos>

<bos> i tend to agree with nyt <unk> ' s review which says : <eos>
<bos> i tend to agree with nyt <unk> ' s review which says : this movie is the individual moments , not the payoff , that make it so effective . i agree this movie has a brilliant script ... <eos>
<bos> that gave this movie the bad reviews by some imdb users , as let <unk> ' s face it , it can totally ruin a movie for some people . a movie about an abused foster child , he subconsciously blames himself for his unhappy <unk> and turns this self - <unk> into a form of self - <unk> in both his professional and emotional lives is a hard sell . <eos>
<bos> for his unhappy <unk> and turns this self - <unk> into a form of self - <unk> in both his professional and emotional lives is a hard sell . my advice : forget the oscar nominations , the <unk> reviews , the famous faces , and sit down to watch this movie with a completely <unk> attitude . right , this is a slow burner , a fine achievement <eos>

<bos> upon frank <unk> ' s opening the closet door , jeffrey shoots him point - blank in the forehead with <unk> . gordon <unk> ' s gun , killing him instantly . probably david lynch <unk> ' s best film . the story has gaps in logic , but it <unk> ' s secondary to some incredible wide screen imagery ( this has to be seen letter - <unk> ... no two ways about it ) . <eos>

<bos> what do you think about the characters in this movie ? my favorite character was obviously the main character because through his perseverance he was able to escape a dangerous situation . mine was the son because the boy falls off the rock wall after having asked greg for permission and other goofball things . <eos>
<bos> the fact that owen wilson returns as kevin and the running joke other than him being some rich worldly hippie is that he <unk> ' s in love with pam , which never amounts to anything . personally i think alba over - <unk> her part , which should have been played by a <unk> attractive woman , proving she has no idea how to shake her type . <eos>
<bos> personally i think alba over - <unk> her part , which should have been played by a <unk> attractive woman , proving she has no idea how to shake her type . it was pretty <unk> when <unk> gets drunk and forcefully kisses and hugs greg , but greg resists and asks her to leave . that part it just was n ' t funny ... <eos>
<bos> that part it just was n ' t funny ... yeah but deniro was funny especially when jack suggests the girl takes after pam and the boy takes after greg . however he was a jerk at the hospital because while there jack tells pam she should divorce greg and marry kevin . <eos>

<bos> have been an insane <unk> act . they did a fantastic job . yeah and screenwriter chris morgan found an appropriate balance between action and story , and director james wan made a fluid and dynamic work . i think when brian calls mia to tell her he loves her in case he does n ' t make it back was a brilliant call by wan . <eos>
<bos> tell her he loves her in case he does n ' t make it back was a brilliant call by wan . besides , the sad death of actor paul walker <unk> ' s brings a gravity to the story which the screenplay could have never generated by itself . i think brian tyler <unk> ' s score is dope tho , it added to the depth of the story . <eos>
<bos> displayed in furious 7 are making some people talk about the possibility of introducing a special category for stunt doubles at the oscars ; and i think that <unk> ' s an excellent idea . did you know there are currently two categories dedicated to the <unk> who mix the audio of car crashes ... and none to the drivers who <unk> their lives ? ridiculous . <eos>

<bos> film . of course , we know this because it was one of the best sf / horror hybrids of the 90s . i totally agree with a <unk> build - up of suspense and terror , watching this film you never really know whether or not any of the leading protagonists will make it out alive . that was a good directors insight from guillermo del toro . <eos>

<bos> what was your favorite scene in this movie ? i liked the one in which the team <unk> there powers but the movie seems to be directed poorly . <eos>
<bos> to be directed poorly . not really , the movie sometimes <unk> in parts but not as a whole . the direction should be hailed for the thoughtful directing of the scene in which victor continues manipulating the environment against the four , pinning them down . i am reviewing this movie based on the point of view of fans of the actual comics . <eos>
<bos> the actual comics . agreed . as a comic book fan i felt like josh <unk> just slapped me in the face by using so very little of the actual comics . he basically used the name of a comic i love to get me to see it and then gave me a different movie . i think , even the casting is awful . <eos>
<bos> that <unk> ' s because , none of the characters matched their comic counter part . they were all too young so of course reed richards did n ' t have gray <unk> , who thought it would be a good idea to make a tiny guy the thing ? the actors of this film should n ' t be blamed , as the complete fault lies with its director . <eos>

<bos> what do you think about the characters in this movie ? my favorite character was john mcclane because he is a complete badass . he is the every man hero in a good movie . <eos>

<bos> not a all and he teams up with sam jackson . the buddy action film has never been better . it has a few different things for a die hard movie . <eos>
<bos> it has a few different things for a die hard movie . it <unk> ' s also the only die hard film where john mcclane is actually working in his own jurisdiction . it <unk> ' s another good addition to these movies . <eos>

<bos> what is your opinion about the movie ? i think it was one of the best heartwarming boston movies ever . yeah it was beautiful in its own way . <eos>
<bos> . not only is the script powerful , but the dynamics between the characters <unk> - <unk> all of them selfish , even <unk> <unk> - <unk> is vividly and plausibly executed . i loved the dynamics when at first , will is defensive and <unk> at sean <unk> ' s repeated <unk> that <unk> " <unk> it <unk> ' s not your fault , <unk> " <unk> but he eventually breaks down in <unk> acknowledgment . <eos>
<bos> a slow burner , a fine achievement in <unk> filming . i agree , i do n ' t know whether matt and ben have ever been in therapy , but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche , how it ducks responsibility , and pushes blame onto others , how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down . <eos>
<bos> , how it ducks responsibility , and pushes blame onto others , how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down . they did great this movie has a brilliant script ... for sure they won the academy award for best original screenplay ! on a side note , i expect affleck to win best director within 10 years . <eos>

<bos> why does hollywood have to mess with perfection ? i was anxious to see it , having read the book several times , and i <unk> ' m a fan of hollywood <unk> ' s first impression of the original tale , the omega man ( 1971 ) . i am biggest fan of richard <eos>

<bos> i agree with that . they set the stage , and it was time to raise the stakes . stuff had to be <unk> . all the fun of the original with a much better , darker plot . well , you also have to consider that the empire was bringing order . they were n ' t all bad . <eos>
<bos> terrific , especially by harrison ford as han solo , and billy dee williams as lando <unk> . oh , yeah . they really defined themselves this time round . i feel like their characters all stood out . everything was in the balance . they made you feel , and then the end ... what an emotional rollercoaster . that fight , right ? <eos>

<bos> and i loved michelle parents too . i loved where the dress episode has convinced michelle <unk> ' s parents that they should give jim a second chance and they schedule a private dinner . woo jim is <unk> smart . <eos>
<bos> not forget how jim lies to stifler that everyone will be gone that night so he can have his private moment with michelle <unk> ' s parent . unfortunately , stifler , thinking that jim will be home alone , sees it as the perfect moment for the bachelor party to take place . i really enjoyed that particular scene but other scenes seems hilariously stupid . <eos>
<bos> hilariously stupid . ok , i admit it . american pie movies are tasteless , goofy and hilariously stupid ... but i love them ! this movie , in my opinion , was the best in the series because it was ... well , the funniest . and also a little touching . it was great but i do n ' t find it very interesting . <eos>

<bos> that was the one good action scene . yeah . i did n ' t expected it to be a great movie , just a good action one , and it failed . definitely not a great movie . <eos>

<bos> kevin costner has always been a wonderful actor , producer , director and musician too . oh yes costner phoned it in <unk> . and i think the story line was brilliant too . <eos>
<bos> and i think the story line was brilliant too . all the other films had completely different aims and even though i love a deep and brilliant story my main objective when i see a film is to be entertained and basically no film does that better than the <unk> . i was entertained too watching it probably because of the brilliant acting also . <eos>
<bos> brilliant . this is without a doubt kevin costner <unk> ' s best role . some people have <unk> that he seemed stiff and unable to portray the emotion of the character and to that i can only ask : were we watching the same movie ? ! he is a hundred percent believable all the way through . he was and also charles martin smith . <eos>

<bos> i thought the other movies in the saga were better . a solid but flawed addition to the star wars saga star wars holds a place in many of our hearts as it brings <unk> memories back to our minds . <eos>
<bos> star wars holds a place in many of our hearts as it brings <unk> memories back to our minds . this is the film that defined my childhood and love for star wars . will always have a place in my heart for it . george lucas is such a great storyteller and imaginative . <eos>

<bos> that barn scenes start out by making you think that it <unk> ' s going to be a fun night . but then , at nightfall , jason continues lurking around the barn while spying on the kids who settle down for a party at the nearby cabin . there is definitely an authentic <unk> ' jason versus the sexy kids <unk> ' <unk> feel to this movie . <eos>
<bos> there is definitely an authentic <unk> ' jason versus the sexy kids <unk> ' <unk> feel to this movie . yeah . what is excellent about this film are some of the same elements that made halloween good . that includes all of the gore ! <eos>
<bos> all of the gore ! yep . you get to see more of fox hanging from the barn and in a truly jaw dropping moment , you get to see all of andy , chopped up after he gets split in two walking on his hands . very gross , and yet that <unk> ' s exactly what you want in a friday the 13th movie . <eos>

<bos> which scene did you like the most in the movie ? i liked the one in which the last victim fought to survive . that was extremely weird . <eos>
<bos> that was extremely weird . i agree they <unk> ' re insanely weird , like they were created in a post - 80s cocaine hangover . and there was so much horror . <eos>
<bos> so much horror . the movie itself is downright horrendous . it starts off as a typical slasher : a few teens leaving prom get stranded in the woods , then they encounter strange characters , and from then it <unk> into a nonsensical screaming battle between everyone . i only watched the movie once and only because of the characters especially renee zellweger . <eos>
<bos> zellweger . same here . i believe the only reason anyone would have any inclination to watch this is because of its leads <unk> - <unk> renee zellweger and matthew mcconaughey <unk> - <unk> who were young and naive back then , but they did they best they could with the material they had . i careless to read about the directing . who actually directed the movie ? <eos>

<bos> i could really empathize when he started school and made new friends . first time my mother ever cried in a cinema . guess which scene . oh , when the kids are left with that abusive father . <eos>
<bos> oh , when the kids are left with that abusive father . yup . but there are real problems . mason being the big one , even if he <unk> ' s my favorite . the intelligent viewer will be unable to connect with such a person . yeah . i kind of tuned out myself . i do n ' t like low class trash . <eos>
<bos> yeah . i kind of tuned out myself . i do n ' t like low class trash . mason walks through this film as if he was in a coma or half asleep ; he has no ambitions . i think that <unk> ' s part of the point though . he <unk> ' s lost in life . <eos>

<bos> apart from the eddie murphy <unk> ' s character nothing else is magical . it is an entertaining diversion , even if the series is no longer magical and that applies especially to the ending series . <eos>
<bos> and that applies especially to the ending series . for me i just want an actual ending to the series . a fucking alternate timeline movie is not an ending ... honestly i was quite disappointed because it did not live up to the standard of the first two films . <eos>

<bos> when i remember jim carrey . too bad he was n ' t used right . jim carrey in his hey day would have been a better joker than he was the <unk> . yeah , there was a period where they did n ' t get him , but at least he made some great films . they were so over the top . cutting edge stuff . <eos>
<bos> get him , but at least he made some great films . they were so over the top . cutting edge stuff . when this movie reruns on <unk> they show the gas station scene for <unk> . oh my . some of those <unk> can be hilarious . cheese and rice . i <unk> ' m sure parents hated this film when we were kids . <eos>

<bos> yeah , that was almost terminator levels of determination . and it fits the structure of the film . first off , <unk> works with flawless effort all of the technical aspects of the film . agreed . i mean , it needs that central figure that can keep it all together like that . it raises the stakes . <eos>
<bos> keep it all together like that . it raises the stakes . and the filming ... beautiful . it even starts with a double exposure effect , mixed with some sad shots of a beautiful <unk> <unk> that hints the spectacle ahead of us . oh , yes . competently done . i really felt i was there , like the city came alive . <eos>
<bos> competently done . i really felt i was there , like the city came alive . one shot especially , from a chopper in a <unk> field edited with a crane shot is breathtaking . nothing to envy from hollywood upper class . amazing what can come out of the rest of the world with a <unk> of the budget we spend in hollywood . <eos>
<bos> what do you think about the characters in this movie ? <eos>
<bos> was sebastian because i relate to him as an artist . one of the things i did n ' t like as much about the movie was how bland the characters felt . they felt like archetypes of artists rather than fleshed out real artists . but there was still a lot of stuff i liked about it . i think he <unk> ' s a great filmmaker . <eos>
<bos> <unk> ' s job as this generation <unk> ' s definitive filmmaker who <unk> jazz into everything . maybe . i mean , this is only his second feature though . it will be interesting to see where he goes next . i preferred whiplash to this , but it <unk> ' s definitely ambitious even when it fails . i think you liked it way more than me though . <eos>

<bos> apart from representing your childhood ? it <unk> ' s a solid film . so many wow moments , too . maybe it was the utter amazement when i first saw the <unk> eat from a tree . yeah , it caught the wonder of it . like you were discovering dinosaurs . <eos>

<bos> i agree but how do you feel about the overall action in this movie ? i disliked it , there is more action in a ronda rosey fight . but , the casting for the roles seemed to suit each actor well , in my opinion . <eos>
<bos> but , the casting for the roles seemed to suit each actor well , in my opinion . they just did n ' t feel like a team <unk> - <unk> there was no bond between them , and that <unk> ' s what should certainly be established in a movie like this . yes , there was a clear waste of great acting talent there . <eos>

<bos> agreed . i mean , ignoring the ridiculous plot . matrix but in <unk> ? nah . it actually felt weird , like <unk> . like astronauts in business suits . something off in that world . <eos>
<bos> it actually felt weird , like <unk> . like astronauts in business suits . something off in that world . i wish the movie was more focused . that <unk> ' s probably the problem . a lot is going on , and it <unk> ' s not clear how it all fits together . it goes beyond simple mystery . <eos>

<bos> real romance , one where you can see the characters fall in love slowly . sure that contributes , it <unk> ' s not like in today <unk> ' s movies where two characters meet and the next scene is when they wake up together . and also has humor . it is not a humorous or cheesy mood , but an ironic , ironic and dry humor . <eos>

<bos> home without saying farewell to her children , takes the elevator alone to the last level where she sees a hotel room . there if there is suspense , when <unk> <unk> ' s enters and realizes that the content is scattered on the floor . she steps on some broken glass and <unk> looks up from the couch , asking what he <unk> ' s doing here . <eos>
<bos> on the floor . she steps on some broken glass and <unk> looks up from the couch , asking what he <unk> ' s doing here . if that part also i like a lot , i almost get a heart attack when , <unk> gets defensive and takes a piece of glass . in short , it <unk> ' s insanely brilliant ! nolan has outdone himself ! <eos>

<bos> what is your opinion about the movie ? i think it was a great and refreshing take on a character we thought we already new ; thus making it a great film . i agree , i did n ' t think it was going to be about how she felt , and thought . <eos>
<bos> she felt , and thought . the plot for this movie really fits into the current trend of exploring the anti - hero ( breaking bad , hannibal ... ) and shows that disney is trying to break with its past depiction of characters being black and white , good or evil , etc . she looked kind of corny in her costume in the trailers . <eos>
<bos> she looked kind of corny in her costume in the trailers . going in , i was excited as a life - long disney fan but also expecting a somewhat cheesy good - vs - evil type of movie based on what i had seen in the trailer . only angelina could have pulled this off . <eos>
<bos> only angelina could have pulled this off . angelina jolie delivers an amazing performance and makes a well - known , previously rather one - <unk> dimensional disney villain relate - able and more sympathetic , while also managing to look like a convincing , gorgeous , magical creature . i think that <unk> ' s kind of who angelina is anyway . <eos>

<bos> this was one of shakespeare <unk> ' s best . it is shakespeare worthy but the directing to my opinion is superb . <eos>
<bos> but the directing to my opinion is superb . i think the australian director manages to combine an exciting mix of original shakespearean <unk> and hollywood action , which together delivers a brilliant new concept to film making . and the chemistry of the main characters seems real to me . <eos>
<bos> and the chemistry of the main characters seems real to me . the casting of leonardo di caprio as romeo and claire danes as juliet are inspired choices , as they both give the best performance of their <unk> careers . oh yes they really did because i never believe it is the same old romeo and juliet story that was acted out . <eos>

<bos> that is a great scene , is that your favorite ? no , my favorite is when one of the early scenes in <unk> " <unk> pulp fiction <unk> " <unk> features two hit - men discussing what a big mac is called in other countries . that is a good one because you get a chance to know the hit - men . <eos>
<bos> that is a good one because you get a chance to know the hit - men . yes , that <unk> ' s because their dialogue is witty and entertaining , and it <unk> ' s also <unk> , because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal . this is one of my favorite movies for sure . <eos>

<bos> it gets spoiled . you need to be surprised . memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie . i <unk> ' m here talking to you . i hear it is also really accurate in its portrayal of memory loss . <eos>
<bos> . i hear it is also really accurate in its portrayal of memory loss . yeah . this is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end , and even afterwards . not many films get it right . they like to <unk> things that look good on the screen , not take from real life . <eos>

<bos> which is your favourite character in this ? my favorite character was james bond because he could fight well of course . he <unk> ' s james bond . <eos>

<bos> it <unk> ' s not perfect . why does n ' t m leave when tanner tells her to ? he tries to warn m , but m refuses to leave and look like a coward . okay , but there are still a few ridiculous bits . <eos>
<bos> okay , but there are still a few ridiculous bits . like when they <unk> the shrapnel in bond <unk> ' s chest to a <unk> ' special ' bullet that only 3 people use ? despite its flaws , it was n ' t bad . <eos>

<bos> loki <unk> ' s relationship with thor saved this film from b - movie status . yeah . most of the characters are completely one - dimensional , with the possible exception of loki . why do they even work together ? <eos>
<bos> why do they even work together ? in return , thor promises loki that he can have his revenge on <unk> for killing their mother . all of the character motivations are a bit hit or miss . <eos>
<bos> all of the character motivations are a bit hit or miss . well , this is a mindless blockbuster marvel movie so we should n ' t expect much . i guess that <unk> ' s what people want , nowadays . <eos>

<bos> arms up trying to get away from the chainsaw . it <unk> ' s not exactly the most intricate storyline , but at least it <unk> ' s not some mindless killer running around killing any teenager daring enough to get involved in any kind of sexual behavior ( an extremely popular motive in cheesy horror movies ) . this was arguably the best of all nine sequels . <eos>

<bos> easy to sympathize with because he <unk> ' s not an action hero . i know , right ? he does n ' t know how to use a gun , he has no combat training , and he <unk> ' s never had to take on terrorists before . this works perfectly with mcclane <unk> ' s own street smarts and action heroics , which they combine in their day - long adventure . <eos>
<bos> action heroics , which they combine in their day - long adventure . i agree . these two have a chemistry that at least equals riggs and murtaugh and if there <unk> ' s a die hard sequel , jackson needs to come back . and the plot is clever , too . like when mcclane and <unk> are forced to complete more games to identify the school . <eos>
<bos> when mcclane and <unk> are forced to complete more games to identify the school . that movie is the reason why i <unk> ' ll forever know how to do that classic puzzle where you have to use only a five <unk> <unk> and a three <unk> <unk> to fill up the big one with exactly four <unk> . favorite movie ever ! keep ze bottle . <eos>

<bos> what was your favorite scene in this movie ? i liked the one in which allen gamble describes his dark personality , <unk> , wanting to get out . although jackson and johnson were also funny here , i hate that the previews gave away their cameos in this movie . <eos>
<bos> although jackson and johnson were also funny here , i hate that the previews gave away their cameos in this movie . it would have been more exciting if the audience did n ' t expect them when they stepped into the theaters . then again , that is the fault of <unk> marketed this film , not the filmmakers themselves . <eos>
<bos> french connection <unk> " <unk> ( 1971 ) or similar action / detective movies to that nature . <unk> " <unk> when you do a comedy , it does no good to reference comedies , <unk> " <unk> writer and director adam <unk> told entertainment weekly , <unk> " <unk> you want to treat it like a drama 80 % of the way . the last 20 % made this movie work , naturally . <eos>
<bos> more than that , though , ferrell did n ' t get all the funny lines , which is the mistake that many buddy cop movies such as the recent <unk> " <unk> cop out <unk> " <unk> ( 2010 ) make . wahlberg is as intense as he usually is in most movies , but he has laugh - <unk> out - loud hilarious lines that he plays effectively with a straight face . <eos>

<bos> i figured this would be an entertaining remake if nothing else , i was wrong . this film , to me , was more like a terrible modern high school cliff - notes adaptation than a remake . incredibly disappointing , a slap in the face to true horror fans <eos>

<bos> loki : <unk> " <unk> ta - <unk> <unk> " <unk> best line of the movie . when loki showed how he truly felt and looked like that moment kicked me right in the feels <unk> seemed wasted to me as an actor , far too much makeup , and the <unk> on his voice basically stopped it from feeling like him . <eos>
<bos> , far too much makeup , and the <unk> on his voice basically stopped it from feeling like him . maybe but the acting was solid . the production value was superb . but everything else was really poor . the back story and character motivations are laughably sparse . most of the characters are completely one - dimensional , with the possible exception of loki . <eos>
<bos> of all action plots <unk> - <unk> some <unk> " <unk> bad dudes who happen to be really ugly <unk> " <unk> decide to <unk> " <unk> destroy the world for no reason other than being evil <unk> " <unk> and <unk> " <unk> only our hero can save us all <unk> " <unk> , etc . moreover , it was lazy writing <unk> - <unk> whenever an absolute miracle needed to happen , it conveniently did , every time . <eos>

<bos> which is your favourite character in this ? my favorite character was <unk> , her performance brought a beautiful spark to the film . performances are outstanding all around , with <unk> once again stealing every second she is on the screen . through her eyes and carefully delivered lines , we understand what attracts us to this special time and place . <eos>
<bos> very talented performer , one who might be truly aware of her standing , yet she does n ' t dwell on it . oh yes . she attracts many types , but her philosophy is unique , move on , enjoy , live the moment . in a way , she is like the city that has inspired allen , and many others before him . <eos>
<bos> way , she is like the city that has inspired allen , and many others before him . the film is set in several time <unk> , and paris glows intensely and <unk> in everyone of those . woo from its <unk> skies and reflective streets , showing lovely architectural details and its magnificent landmarks to the superb and lovely <unk> of older time <unk> <eos>
<bos> to the superb and lovely <unk> of older time <unk> oh yes one ca n ' t help being seduced , <unk> , and inspired to find a way to show what a special place , and consequently what a truly magical film this might be . maybe paris as a place might not be aware of its magnetism , its beauty , and its power . <eos>

<bos> <unk> " <unk> tng was actually directed by the dude that co - wrote the original with tobe hooper . well said , <unk> . whatever this movie is supposed to be , it fails on every level . it <unk> ' s not scary , it <unk> ' s not disturbing , it <unk> ' s not entertaining , it <unk> ' s only funny periodically when you ca n ' t believe how stupid it is , <eos>
<bos> , and and it essentially killed the texas chainsaw massacre franchise until it was rebooted a decade later . i think the only reason anyone would have any inclination to watch this is because of its leads <unk> - <unk> renee zellweger and matthew mcconaughey <unk> - <unk> who were young and naive back then , but they did they best they could with the material they had . <eos>

<bos> superhero movies nowadays have managed to flesh out their stories and make them very enjoyable . i reckon . you hope and feel it will go somewhere , but in its hour and a half running time , it feels so empty . i <unk> ' m still very surprised over just how bad it turned out . this film is currently a box office catastrophe . <eos>

<bos> which is your favourite character in this ? my favorite <unk> was jerry <unk> i <unk> ' ve always thought fargo would make a great <unk> play ; you could alter the modern elements and still have created a buzz 400 years ago in suburban england . <eos>
<bos> buzz 400 years ago in suburban england . indeed , the plot is similar to hamlet <unk> ' s , in that they both have characters we root for who create zany plans than end up spinning wildly out of control into bloodshed . many people seem to like fargo for its humorous qualities , its characterization of the <unk> culture and frances mcdormand - <unk> not me . <eos>
<bos> , william h macy , <unk> <unk> and steve buscemi , its ignorance of political correctness ( how many movies can you remember when the only two minority characters were both revealed to be creeps ) . i have seen this film over , well , an embarrassing number of times and have committed its screenplay , from start to finish , by memory . <eos>
<bos> , by memory . fargo is the ultimate coen brothers movie , a brilliant tragedy , and restores my faith in roger ebert as he places this movie in as his fourth favorite movie of the <unk> ' 90s . i want to draw attention to an overlooked reason why the film works so well <unk> - <unk> how well the music suits the visuals in this movie . <eos>

<bos> the original star wars trilogy . it has all the great qualities that the original star wars has : great effects ( at the time of its release ) , appealing characters , and lots of <unk> action . it also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first : the storyline is tighter , and goes much deeper into character development . <eos>
<bos> first : the storyline is tighter , and goes much deeper into character development . the performances are terrific , especially by harrison ford as han solo , and billy dee williams as lando <unk> . the conclusion , with a lightsaber duel between darth vader and luke skywalker , is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series . <eos>

<bos> the fourth in the series and that is getting pretty ridiculous but this one has many memorable moments in it . also where else can you go see sharon stone , david spade , and a <unk> appearance by a young kid at the time named tony hawke . no where else can you get so many people in one of their first movies . <eos>
<bos> no where else can you get so many people in one of their first movies . it is also still highly entertaining and causes me to laugh often . this is where you should stop watching the series however b / c they lose steve <unk> and he is the only reason the series kept on for as long as it did . <eos>

<bos> what do you think about the characters in this movie ? my favorite character was <unk> . he was an amazing person who gave up his life to make sure katniss could kill snow . my favorite scene : when coin gets killed . just the way the music lined up so well . <eos>
<bos> ok , it <unk> ' s not that part 1 was good , you actually knew it would suck , but the 2nd really grinds my gears . you have in your hands a civil war , the final battle into the heart of the capital , and you spent 2 hours of your life watching your main character taking a walk in a war zone . <eos>
<bos> was it in for like 45 seconds , as was t - bag , and even remy danton had a tiny role . wasted actors . and with all that time <unk> , you have no character development , for none of them , just a few moments that the movie is like <unk> " <unk> ok , from now on , that <unk> ' s how things are <unk> " <unk> . <eos>

<bos> i particularly liked how quentin sees that the parents of all children chase krueger and then burn him alive . i figured it would be an entertaining new version , it <unk> ' s kind of boring . but it <unk> ' s a classic , the mystery that all the other children have been killed , most of them asleep , is the same throughout the saga . <eos>
<bos> , the mystery that all the other children have been killed , most of them asleep , is the same throughout the saga . there is no comparison , there was a mysterious element much richer in the original movie and to my surprise , much more creative . you <unk> ' re right . <unk> , <unk> and cgi can not compete with practical creativity . <eos>

<bos> wow , one of the most bizarre horror franchises ever ! well said , <unk> . whatever this movie is supposed to be , it fails on every level . tcm : tng was actually directed by the dude that co - wrote the original with tobe hooper . <eos>
<bos> that co - wrote the original with tobe hooper . it <unk> ' s not scary , it <unk> ' s not disturbing , it <unk> ' s not entertaining , it <unk> ' s only funny periodically when you ca n ' t believe how stupid it is , and it essentially killed the texas chainsaw massacre franchise until it was rebooted a decade later . but still way better than all the post 2000 iterations <eos>

<bos> <unk> and shia would n ' t know how to fake chemistry if someone wrapped a lead pipe in the periodic table and beat them upside their <unk> faces for an hour . yeah . amazing visual spectacle but tedious and full of cliches . i feel like its 3 hour runtime should be mentioned in the op . <eos>
<bos> i tend to agree with nyt <unk> ' s review which says : <eos>
<bos> i tend to agree with nyt <unk> ' s review which says : this movie is would be a little better than <unk> " <unk> part i <unk> " <unk> or <unk> " <unk> part ii <unk> " <unk> even without 3 - d the beginning is very well done . <eos>
<bos> make an effective sequel that is much scarier than the first and next to the final chapter , it is the best and scariest among all the <unk> . in the original version , you just see a glimpse of him as his blood drips onto the magazine , but now , you see his blood , his legs severed , and much more . <eos>
<bos> there are numerous times when the camera scans the for - ground and you are so sure that jason is going to show up , and then he does n ' t until <unk> , someone loses an eye or their life . and it was dumb chris then wanders over to the lake and falls asleep in a <unk> that drifts into the middle of the lake . <eos>

<bos> which scene did you like the most in the movie ? i like the one in which the <unk> starts . an excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist . instead of following the trial itself , the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room . <eos>
<bos> yes no bombs , no car chases but edge of the seat stuff none the less what he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think . the film succeeds in doing something very rare today <unk> - <unk> developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable , memorable and distinct characters . <eos>

<bos> cat that prim is gone and never coming back . me too <unk> - <unk> i did n ' t expected it to be a great movie , just a good action one , and it failed in that respect . for goodness sake , london has fallen had more character development than a book based <unk> , lotr had less walking ... good <unk> to the series . <eos>

<bos> another great movie gangster of the 1980s david spade ! but why is this movie rated so low ? maybe <unk> : not just another funny movie <eos>
<bos> many memorable moments in it . also where else can you go see sharon stone , david spade , and a <unk> appearance by a young kid at the time named tony hawke . of course no where else can you get so many people in one of their first movies . it is also still highly entertaining and causes me to laugh often . <eos>

<bos> <unk> ) , who had the same problem . memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie . his is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end , and even afterwards <eos>
<bos> what do you think about the movie ? <eos>
<bos> a group of people can make a romantic comedy with zombies , then a buddy cop film had to inventive and original . why were the townspeople being murdered anyway ? the nwa reveals that they have all been behind the murders , with their motive simply being <unk> pride , and had nothing to do with property deal between those who were murdered . <eos>
<bos> violently opposed : the <unk> and his girlfriend were murdered because their terrible acting brought ill <unk> to <unk> <unk> ' s theatre company , the businessman was murdered for owning a tacky home , the journalist for poor spelling , and the <unk> for even thinking about moving away . i have n ' t laughed as hard in a film as i did with hot fuzz . <eos>

<bos> its an underrated and undervalued scorsese classic oh yes , along with mean streets casino is probably scorsese <unk> ' s most underrated and unheralded picture . i would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film . the film deals with a particular time period and a particular atmosphere and accomplishes an overwhelming achievement by creating and accurately portraying both . <eos>
<bos> portraying both . even the art direction is splendid , most likely the best of any film scorsese has ever done . the acting is superb . honestly , i never thought pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in raging bull until i saw casino . every time i watch this picture i fall in love with it all over again . <eos>

<bos> what is your opinion about the movie ? i think it was a fun movie . the spiderman movies will make money no matter good or bad they are . but that does n ' t mean they should not try to . <eos>
<bos> but why did this movie get made ? i think its simple , sam raimi was n ' t given enough time to make a fourth spider - man film so he quit , and the fans wanted to see the lizard on screen . this movie was n ' t made for any other reason . first off , peter parker does n ' t have a goal in this movie . <eos>
<bos> parker does n ' t have a goal in this movie . so , after the post credits it says spider - man will be back ... and then shows sony and colombia house logo ... so that <unk> ' s it for spidey in the mcu ? i do n ' t know if my eyes are playing tricks on me , i swear some of the scenes are 60 fps . <eos>

<bos> i tend to agree with nyt <unk> ' s review which says : this movie is an odd mixture : a deeply personal impersonal movie so is this the beginning of the marvel cinematic multiverse ? <eos>

<bos> story that goes nowhere , and with over 2 hour runtime it is one hell of a boring movie . when everything is said and done hugo reveals itself as nothing but a cleverly disguised homage to one of the french <unk> movie directors , a subject interesting primarily for the movie history buffs . as i said hugo is hugely <unk> in advertising . <eos>

<bos> without using <unk> or clich <unk> ' <unk> pull - back shots showing the numbers of people homeless and in soup lines , howard makes the depression a visceral reality with scenes of near - hopeless men at the docks , pleading for a day <unk> ' s work ; a stolen <unk> ; crowe <unk> ' s giving his daughter his breakfast piece of <unk> , telling her he dreamed he was full . <eos>
<bos> <unk> ; crowe <unk> ' s giving his daughter his breakfast piece of <unk> , telling her he dreamed he was full . although i was expecting another retelling / twist type story but i was pleasantly surprised . the audience was like a prize fight audience , cheering , <unk> , gasping , groaning during the fights . we applauded <unk> <unk> ' s wins , suffered his defeats . <eos>

<bos> the producers who took a chance on such <unk> subject matter . well said . bravo to the producers of this movie for giving this project the <unk> , because the sexually - active youth of today would never know the plague and tragedy that preceded their coming - of - age without a reminder like this . it is a <unk> true story with gritty realism and excellent performances . <eos>

<bos> , dozens of them , some in the <unk> of strange <unk> symbols , others clearly meant to represent human forms . yeah , i think they really should have done more with the rock piles and voodoo figures . just goes to show , you can be scary without the overpowering f / x and music score most movies rely on to <unk> ' scare <unk> ' <unk> you . <eos>

<bos> story rather well . maybe yes and what <unk> ' s particularly interesting about <unk> ' rocky ii <unk> ' <unk> is that apart from repeating the central theme of fighting apollo creed ( carl weathers ) , rocky ( stallone ) goes through a character arc here that many sequels totally ignore we see the after - effects of his fight , and him struggling to adapt to the <unk> ' new life . <eos>

<bos> so so so good . cant stop thinking about it . i am the same age as the characters and every time these movies have struck deep . its so little time , so much love . oh yes , its absolutely fantastic . easily the best film of the year . <eos>
<bos> year . even the dialogue is amazing , the acting is spot - on ; this is a great film . and in some ways it felt more like reading a great novel than watching a movie , in that i really felt like i knew the characters and was sad the movie had to end . kind of like saying goodbye to an old friend . <eos>

<bos> what do you think about the movie ? i think it was very good , very family friendly , good comedy , with little <unk> violence . i watched this movie <unk> <unk> for a year when i was a kid . and i still love it . and the book is even better ! <eos>
<bos> it for the first time too . it was fantastic . just watched pulp fiction as well , which was equally as good . for the scene of <unk> , elwes and <unk> had to study <unk> for months , which is impressive , but on - screen , i had no trouble believing that they were characters who had <unk> for at least several years . <eos>
<bos> andre the giant is perfect for the role of <unk> , and something would be lost with any other actor in his place . and of course , wallace shawn is endlessly amusing to watch as the <unk> , perpetually exasperated <unk> . we also do n ' t have to hear christopher guest and chris sarandon speak any lines to know they are portraying villains . <eos>

<bos> what do you think about the movie ? i think it was a pretty funny funny movie . jim carrey is a great actor the mask was a perfect vehicle for jim carrey . <eos>
<bos> some of stanley <unk> ' s <unk> and scares a street gang that attempts to <unk> him . the success of the film wholly depends on carrey , as he has to sell his characters <unk> ' <unk> frenzied insanity so that it <unk> ' s believable as a reflection of stanley <unk> ' s inner self while at the same time likable but <unk> on the edge of becoming <unk> overbearing . <eos>
<bos> while at the same time likable but <unk> on the edge of becoming <unk> overbearing . the subtext about identity and public faces versus private <unk> is interesting , but not the focus ... it would be fine to explore further , but to do so in this particular film would have taken too much time away from carrey <unk> ' s <unk> tour de force . <eos>

<bos> i think the acting is superb . oh yes , i never thought pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in raging bull until i saw casino . it <unk> ' s the most uncompromising studio picture of the 1990s . <eos>
<bos> honest depiction of las vegas , especially of the time period it was portrayed in . and scorsese <unk> ' s direction is flawless . perhaps it is because i watch alot of scorsese and kubrick films , but i am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more <unk> by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just do n ' t seem to hold . <eos>
<bos> what is your opinion about the movie ? <eos>
<bos> what is your opinion about the movie ? i think it was based on romanticism and fantasy i also believed it but i could not have been more wrong ! angelina jolie offers an incredible performance and makes a known disney villain , previously quite one - dimensional , relate and be more understanding , while also manages to look like a magical and convincing creature <eos>
<bos> the beast * ! to tell the truth the cgi is a heavy one and a little freaky at times ( such as the three colored <unk> <unk> / <unk> <unk> ) but was used , in combination with some amazing sets , to create a fantastic world and creatures which were reminiscent of the beautiful and imaginative work in movies such as <unk> " <unk> hellboy 2 <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> some amazing sets , to create a fantastic world and creatures which were reminiscent of the beautiful and imaginative work in movies such as <unk> " <unk> hellboy 2 <unk> " <unk> it is interesting that they find game changer in the fairytale genre , i liked that . i loved the backstory they gave to maleficent . nice to see how the classic villains turn <unk> " <unk> evil <unk> " <unk> <eos>

<bos> what nyt had to say about the movie this movie is in mcgregor ... the film has an actor whose magnetism <unk> our attention no matter what yes , i agree with you about mcgregor and you can witness it in th movie when he begins enjoying his new life of <unk> but it <unk> ' s short - lived after <unk> <unk> ' s involved in an armed robbery . <eos>
<bos> when he begins enjoying his new life of <unk> but it <unk> ' s short - lived after <unk> <unk> ' s involved in an armed robbery . it is sublimely excellent and it is also one of the best films of the 1990s . whether this film is gritty and dirty ! sic ! after reading some of the reviews that trash this film i had to speak up . <eos>
<bos> . yeah , there are people who gave negative reviews . for such people , my question would be what else would you expect a film about drug addiction to be about ? never at any point did this film make drugs look at all appealing to me in any way , i never did understand why so many people thought that it did . <eos>

<bos> , others in the library begin to first stare and then move away , and the librarian suggests beckett retire to a private room . i was so happy when disgusted by their behavior , miller approaches beckett and reviews the material he has gathered . tom hanks gives perhaps the most powerful performance of his career as andrew beckett , the <unk> lawyer . <eos>
<bos> most powerful performance of his career as andrew beckett , the <unk> lawyer . his appearance in the film encapsulates the reality of the aids epidemic , in that it often touched our lives in unexpected places . denzel washington was well cast as the <unk> lawyer who ultimately takes hanks <unk> ' <unk> case , and mary <unk> is surprising in an <unk> villain role . <eos>

<bos> was kind of a lull in the middle , but overall a really fun movie . the fight scene of street brawl fired by the feud between the <unk> and <unk> families was good . it was due to a lovely mixture of fast editing and beautifully choreographed fight scenes , which would n ' t look out of place in a john woo action film . <eos>
<bos> fight scenes , which would n ' t look out of place in a john woo action film . and also even though i knew the ending i became excited when <unk> , juliet <unk> ' s cousin challenges romeo to a duel on discovering that he had sneaked into the ball . ya <unk> manages to keep the audience hoping that this time it will be different . <eos>

<bos> old lady transforms into a <unk> fairy and introduces herself as ella <unk> ' s fairy godmother ( helena bonham carter ) . and the best was when the fairy godmother wastes little time in transforming a <unk> , ella <unk> ' s mouse friends , a goose , and some <unk> into a spectacular carriage , four while horses , a coachman , and <unk> , respectively . <eos>

<bos> gave away their cameos in this movie . agreed , it would have been more exciting if the audience did n ' t expect them when they stepped into the theaters . the movie tells a great story , everyone in the movie is funny without appearing to try too hard ( especially in ferrell <unk> ' s case ) , and the ensemble cast works together perfectly . <eos>

<bos> too much about the movie , and that <unk> ' s just plain frustrating . its an unforgettable trip into the mind of a man with no memory oh yes and i think memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie . <eos>
<bos> they thought of the movie . this is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end , and even afterwards . the story and the direction are the best i <unk> ' ve seen so far this year , and it deserves all the kudos it gets . i can say say its addictive and fun to figure out <eos>

<bos> which is your favourite character in this ? my favorite character was dorothy , because i thought that she was played brilliantly by isabella <unk> . yeah , she acted well in the scene in which frank enters dorothy <unk> ' s apartment and taunts jeffrey about having heard jeffrey <unk> ' s location over his own police radio . <eos>
<bos> while watching the scene in which upon frank <unk> ' s opening the closet door , jeffrey shoots him point - blank in the forehead with <unk> . it is probably david lynch <unk> ' s best film . the story has gaps in logic , but it <unk> ' s secondary to some incredible wide screen imagery ( this has to be seen letter - <unk> ... no two ways about it ) . <eos>
<bos> ) . now i know , that <unk> ' s why lynch has said in interviews that he thinks of the image first then works it into the movie . spoiler alert ! this movie also demands multiple viewings ... i was so shocked the first time i saw it , i could n ' t concentrate on it ... it took three viewings to finally get it . <eos>

<bos> which is your favourite character in this ? my favourite character was the queen i think the plot is fairy tale in nature <eos>
<bos> i think the plot is fairy tale in nature but fun & entertaining ! : and this is not a movie for little girls dressed in <unk> who want to be princesses when they grow up . for the first time in the studio <unk> ' s <unk> ( i <unk> ' d <unk> ) this film depicts the responsibility of <unk> . <eos>
<bos> but for my money the best part of this movie is the love story . no , not mia and the uniquely attractive <unk> ( although , that is great ) . that <unk> ' s terrific . it <unk> ' s about being yourself and <unk> yourself . it <unk> ' s about knowing who your real friends are . it <unk> ' s about living up to your own expectations . <eos>
<bos> which was the best scene in the movie according to you ? <eos>
<bos> which was the best scene in the movie according to you ? i liked the one in which the history of freddy was told to the children . it <unk> ' s incredibly disappointing , a slap in the face to true horror fans <eos>
<bos> the rest seemed like <unk> , recycled and poorly delivered lines <unk> stolen from all the nightmare films . ( ex . robert <unk> ' s <unk> " <unk> your eyes say no , no , but your body says yes , yes . <unk> " <unk> from freddy vs. jason ) and i do n ' t understand why everything needs to be explained in full now . i hate that . <eos>
<bos> that . i thin the new <unk> ' nancy in the bathtub <unk> ' <unk> scene was a boring cop - out and seemed more or less to be suggesting that it could be frightening . even tina <unk> ' s death being dragged across the ceiling was more vicious and sadistic in the original . every <unk> ' scare <unk> ' <unk> in this film is the clich loud music and somebody jumping into frame . <eos>
<bos> i agree with what nyt had to say about the movie <eos>
<bos> i agree with what nyt had to say about the movie this movie is one of the most complex and visually interesting science fiction movies in a long time . in terms of the visceral , total recall often rides a gray area somewhere between action and horror . <eos>
<bos> total recall often rides a gray area somewhere between action and horror . while the action is n ' t as explosive as many schwarzenegger films , the suspense never resolves until the end . like when before the memory <unk> procedure can begin , quaid goes into a violent rage , <unk> about his cover being blown and how men are coming to kill him . <eos>
<bos> goes into a violent rage , <unk> about his cover being blown and how men are coming to kill him . or when on the way to work he sees an advertisement on the subway tv for <unk> , inc. , a facility that <unk> fake memories of ideal <unk> . great action , great suspense , great cultural satire , and a great mind - bender <eos>

<bos> and that backstory is sure to attract ladies at the bar . the film starts with a brief recap of david webb ( matt damon ) when he first joined treadstone , going into his training to become an assassin and into his new life as the jason bourne . which is nice , because at this point , the story is very confusing . <eos>
<bos> which is nice , because at this point , the story is very confusing . after exposing <unk> ( in <unk> ' the bourne ultimatum <unk> ' <unk> ) , bourne has been hiding out in <unk> for the past eight years . i just remember his gypsy girlfriend getting killed . but at least he stays in shape . he <unk> ' s still top of his game . <eos>

<bos> no bugs in them . and then , do you remember the <unk> <unk> scene with the kids ? he catches first one , then the <unk> and kills them quickly and brutally . are you trying to say that the screen could <unk> ' ve been covered in beautiful butterflies and the scene would have still been as creepy because he <unk> ' s killing the kids ? <eos>

<bos> you do n ' t want to miss out watching salander and blomkvist great performance . oh yes i agree because if you have already followed salander and blomkvist during the previous books / movies , you will surely enjoy watching how the conspiracy is being unraveled through intense investigations and court trials . the excitement you get watching it can not be gotten by just reading it . <eos>
<bos> to experience how the <unk> crumble beneath salander and <unk> combined efforts at exposing and confronting the deeper reasons for <unk> struggles , and how they piece the puzzle together to clear her name and taking down the shady factions of society . it was just a great movie and i am convinced you will enjoy every bit of it if you watch it . <eos>

<bos> think about the characters in this movie ? my favorite character was prince <unk> because he was more an antihero than a villain . he had good reasons for most of his actions . i do n ' t know , i felt the character was over the top and not justified in his actions like when he is in the chamber of the golden army . <eos>

<bos> edgar wright proved that he has great directing skills in this movie . this film works both as an out - and - out comedy but also as a high paced action film and also manages to showcase the directing talents of edgar wright . both the <unk> and the second half were captivating but i enjoyed the more of the comedy in the second half . <eos>
<bos> what is your opinion about the movie ? <eos>
<bos> what is your opinion about the movie ? i think it was the best in the franchise . maybe so but its a very funny movie and it <unk> my heart the day i watched it . <eos>
<bos> the day i watched it . for what it <unk> ' s worth , this instalment is better than the last but fails to hold a candle to shrek 2 and pales to the point of apparition when compared to the original . i think this shrek is extremely humorous and compared to the previous it is the best for me even compared to the original . <eos>
<bos> best for me even compared to the original . but the characters that <unk> the <unk> " <unk> shrek <unk> " <unk> universe remain as endearing as ever in principle , but after four movies there is little that can be done to keep them animated , so to speak . they were still awesome as before even more this time . mike mitchell did a splendid job . <eos>
<bos> before even more this time . mike mitchell did a splendid job . yes he and his team did but they did n ' t capture the magic of the first two . but better than the 3rd installment . the first two might be better so to speak but this shrek is the funniest and much more entertaining . maybe you need to watch it again <eos>

<bos> what is your opinion about the movie ? i think the movie was a wonderful cinematic experience for his time . for me it is the best american musical fantasy film i have watched in over a decade now . <eos>
<bos> are seen and enjoyed at a variety of <unk> " <unk> levels . <unk> " <unk> that is true of this movie in general and of gene wilder in specific . gene wilder has always been one of the best comic actors in his time and his role as willy wonka made the movie . the producers could not have asked for a better actor for the character . <eos>
<bos> in the circles of movie creators as a creative genius for many years . here , his acting ability showcases that genius . to be sure , at the level of good fun for kids and <unk> and <unk> , he comes through . he is not only an actor but also a singer - <unk> and author and was awesome in most of the songs . <eos>
<bos> he is not only an actor but also a singer - <unk> and author and was awesome in most of the songs . oh yes the stage play more or less confirms this . lol because on stage we have to watch a live song . he presence was greatly felt . <eos>

<bos> which was the best scene in the movie according to you ? i liked the one in which isabella <unk> seduced kyle <unk> dorothy <unk> is just a smart character and played excellently by isabella <unk> . <eos>
<bos> dorothy <unk> is just a smart character and played excellently by isabella <unk> . jeffrey is also a smart character . jeffrey <unk> ( kyle <unk> ) is the boy who finds the ear . my favorite character is actually sandy williams played by laura <unk> . maybe i like her because of her blonde hair . <eos>
<bos> daughter who assists jeffrey when he decides to investigate the truth about his disturbing discovery . sandy and jeffrey link the ear to night club singer dorothy <unk> ( isabella <unk> ) and later , a deranged man named frank booth ( dennis hopper ) . she was also a smart character and laura herself is pretty smart . i always enjoy her movies . <eos>
<bos> as the lost innocent jeffrey , and hopper shreds the screen as his depraved counterpoint frank . <unk> <unk> ' s performance as dorothy is devastating and extremely courageous : this is her defining moment as an actress . i think so because i have never knew that isabella was this excellent until i watched the movie . the actors really made the movie a classic . <eos>

<bos> which was the best scene in the movie according to you ? i like the one in which the main character <unk> ' s jet was shot down in the beginning of the movie . that scene does n ' t make any sense to me but i really enjoyed robert de niro as jack . <eos>
<bos> is reunited . when he tries to apologize to jack for arguing with him the night before , jack punches greg and the two start fighting . the story seems out of point . this is the worst series for me . robert was great though but ben stiller seems to have missed it this time . and the plot was not well <unk> . <eos>
<bos> but the script <unk> on typical <unk> " <unk> misunderstanding <unk> " <unk> plot devices , most of which were ironically used most effectively in <unk> " <unk> meet the parents <unk> " <unk> and <unk> " <unk> meet the <unk> . <unk> " <unk> the jokes yes can make you laugh a bit but does not make any sense . i do n ' t think they have any clever jokes this time . just empty jest . <eos>
<bos> any clever jokes this time . just empty jest . maybe true because attempted jokes such as young henry randomly asking if girls poop from their <unk> at the dinner table , could have been replaced with something more thoughtful <unk> - <unk> - <unk> and tasteful . the movie is just a piece of scrap . i actually got attracted to it because of the previous series . <eos>

<bos> what do you think about the movie ? i think it was a fun movie . wow , this was an awesome but not fantastic for me . <eos>
<bos> but not fantastic for me . the selling point of the story is the point when peter parker ( andrew garfield ) sneaks into a research facility and gets bitten by a <unk> / genetically enhanced spider . he gets super powers and becomes spider - man . that was a very unique story and that has made spider man to be loved by most people especially children . <eos>
<bos> children . not so great a film for me but also this is not a bad film . it <unk> ' s well acted by all the principals , has good effects , a scary and menacing villain , some nice action sequences and web swinging effects that are generally slightly more realistic than the <unk> version . for me i still prefer the <unk> version . <eos>
<bos> is much better . it <unk> ' s fair to say that for anyone over the age of <unk> , this movie will seem rather half - hearted and senseless ; for those under <unk> , this movie will probably be the greatest super hero flick ever . on the contrary i am just <unk> and i still prefer the sam <unk> version of 2002 over this one . <eos>

<bos> it is my best american fantasy movie . i love that scene where barbossa agrees but <unk> applies another loophole and <unk> elizabeth and jack on a deserted island ( the same island jack was on ten years before ) and throws jack <unk> ' s crew into the <unk> . that barbossa character is <unk> and geoffrey rush played his role excellently . <eos>
<bos> that barbossa character is <unk> and geoffrey rush played his role excellently . all the actors did great . its a great adventure . well played <unk> . great laughs . great music . and great story . and an unbeatable directing by gore verbinski . <eos>

<bos> which scene did you like the most in the movie ? i like the one in which max is put on <unk> . max is an obsessed teenager . <eos>
<bos> should be one of the greatest films ever ? i do n ' t think that <unk> ' s an understatement , and i <unk> ' m not just saying it cause i <unk> ' m a bill murray fan and he happens to be in it . bill murray did great as usual but i think jason <unk> put up the best act in the movie . he was stunningly funny . <eos>
<bos> murray did great as usual but i think jason <unk> put up the best act in the movie . he was stunningly funny . the whole thing is seriously funny and somehow seriously real , but at the same time does n ' t always take itself seriously . i like the movie though not my best . some of the plots were out of sequence . <eos>
<bos> has a fantastic script , believable character development , and top - notch acting , and that <unk> ' s what counts in making a memorable film . i agree the movie is memorable because it has some funny characters that you can not easily forget . but it lacks that excellent touch of wes anderson . i think he got it a little bit wrong this time . <eos>

<bos> what an intelligent movie . there is only one word to describe the cinematography , the set designs and the special effects , and that is exceptional ! the movie is somehow of a mystery but you definitely feel the impact of every act . <eos>
<bos> movie is somehow of a mystery but you definitely feel the impact of every act . that <unk> ' s true you do n ' t just watch the scenes happening , you feel them . the movie is a real thrill ride . dom cobb <unk> ' s skills of stealing dreams from peoples subconscious mind was very inventive and engaging and leonardo dicaprio gave it the best shot . <eos>
<bos> who is still <unk> known for jack dawson played by him in titanic , should be relieved as his role as dom cobb will be remembered forever . his performance may or may not fetch him an oscar but it will be his finest performance till date . the movie definitely deserve an oscar . it has a great story , plot and cast . <eos>

<bos> which was the best scene in the movie according to you ? i like the one in which <unk> has an intimate conversation with the taxi driver , that was one of the best scenes . the movie is n ' t that bad . <eos>
<bos> have seen without doubt and i do n ' t expect it will be beaten as far as i am concerned . really , i know this is a nice movie but i do n ' t see it to be among the top 5 american black comedy neo - noir crime film , maybe the top 10 or even top 20 or else if i am missing something here . <eos>
<bos> top 10 or even top 20 or else if i am missing something here . of course you missed something . you <unk> ' ve only seen it once . watch it again . great movies deserve multiple viewings . i doubt if i missed anything in the movie that will make be to think that this movie is the best that can not be beaten . <eos>
<bos> its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone , but i still remember watching it for the first time , and it blew me away . anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema . for it to actually change the history of cinema should not make it the best lol . <eos>

<bos> it <unk> ' s a very amusing movie . my initial reaction is that this film is the best romantic comedy that i <unk> ' ve seen in years . it is still the best and my favorite character is cal . he is such an entertaining lover . <eos>
<bos> tremendous heart and charisma and it <unk> ' s so very easy to get caught up in to the lives of these characters . a certain degree of patience is required while viewing because some secondary characters that feel unnecessary to the story are worth getting to know . i actually was connected to all the characters . there were all so amazing the plot on point <eos>
<bos> i actually was connected to all the characters . there were all so amazing the plot on point the entire cast here is perfection . the overall message may be one to debate but it does n ' t matter because the ride and this film are just so smart and so well done . i doubt if anyone will dislike or <unk> of this movie . <eos>

<bos> it is a unique horror movie . <unk> " <unk> let the right one in <unk> " <unk> is , at its heart , a sweet coming - of - age story which is so unique and different that it simply defies <unk> . honestly i have never seen anything like it before now and those two kids <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> were awesome as <unk> and eli . <eos>
<bos> honestly i have never seen anything like it before now and those two kids <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> were awesome as <unk> and eli . they both have a fantastic love story . i should rather call it a horror full love . and the twist in their love or rather the story seems unpredictable . <eos>

<bos> no , i get that , but it was n ' t compelling . i guess it was a lacklustre story line lacking intelligence , dialogue , and character development . lacking a lot of dialogue . <eos>
<bos> lacking a lot of dialogue . still , i am a big fan of the franchise and my expectations may have been too high for this sequel . it <unk> ' s just that damon does n ' t say anything . <eos>

<bos> it took me a while to like this film , but now i love it . essentially perfect and endlessly quotable . and it just comes off so strange . like the film is about pod people , or the <unk> wives . <eos>
<bos> comes off so strange . like the film is about pod people , or the <unk> wives . like when the other police officers are content with explanation , despite nick <unk> ' s concerns about the lack of <unk> marks at the scene . yeah . it <unk> ' s a slow <unk> , but then it <unk> up and you <unk> ' ve got a granny with guns . <eos>

<bos> a lot of great and tense scenes . i was on the edge of my seat when george initially refuses to cooperate , even after malone assaults him . some parts feel a bit dated , but taken in context it is absolutely perfect . <eos>

<bos> yeah , but that scene ... it was a little daft . i also thought it was out of character as charles beats <unk> with a pole down to the ground , with the intent of sacrificing <unk> <unk> ' s life so the rest can escape to safety . he was level headed , and then just went crazy . <eos>

<bos> they keep getting heavier and more elaborate . but the villains do not . <unk> , meanwhile , makes his way down a stairway at temple tube station . that plan was so contrived . i hated it . <eos>
<bos> the mi6 many years back , m sent him on a mission , things go wrong on the mission , <unk> gets captured ( we do n ' t get shown any of this ) and years later <unk> feels as though he wants to kill an older , <unk> and fairly <unk> m. it was a real overreaction , but it got what he deserved . <eos>

<bos> it showed she took her job seriously . you know , with a <unk> build - up of suspense and terror , watching this film you never really know whether or not any of the leading protagonists will make it out alive . even the kids were potential victims . <eos>
<bos> even the kids were potential victims . the science fiction story line is almost convincing enough to make parts of the plot seem possible . it is a really good film , and way underrated . <eos>

<bos> they <unk> into something real , but in retrospect it was a bad and annoying film . just so stupid how the three go missing , but a year later their footage is found in a bag inexplicably buried under an abandoned 100 - year - old house . i mean , why did those people not get killed by the witch , and who edited the film ? <eos>

<bos> i never saw the original , myself , but want to , now , just to compare . in the case of this adaption we are safe in the knowledge that the actors at least wanted to be there and that they all had fun making it . and that <unk> ' s what helps to make a film , with everyone working together . <eos>
