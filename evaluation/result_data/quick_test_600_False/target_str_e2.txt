<bos> final half of the second story <eos>
<bos> <unk> to its <unk> , i found the first movie highly <unk> for its unique <unk> and interesting characters , while the sequel did n ' t really catch me due to a <unk> storyline and little <unk> . <eos>

<bos> this movie is very similar to the original and <unk> i have a problem with this . <eos>
<bos> most of them are good but the first one stands on it <unk> ' s own . always been a favourite of <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i <unk> ' ll be first to admit that i hate teen comedies in general and <unk> <unk> upon most of them <unk> - <unk> i did n ' t even like <unk> " <unk> there <unk> ' s something about mary <unk> " <unk> too much , although i <unk> ' m not sure it <unk> ' s really a <unk> " <unk> teen <unk> " <unk> film . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great movie and a good modern twist on the classic . <eos>
<bos> the cgi becomes a <unk> here ; it <unk> ' s when things look too perfect that they lose <unk> such as freddy <unk> the wall above <unk> . <eos>
<bos> that was scary , <unk> and left people thinking that perhaps <unk> was <unk> <unk> and that <unk> had <unk> himself . <eos>
<bos> incredibly <unk> , a <unk> in the face to true horror fans <eos>
<bos> i liked the one with the dance by <unk> <unk> and john <unk> <eos>
<bos> i agree i think the movie is nothing special <eos>
<bos> there <unk> ' s a nice moral <unk> to the stories . we <unk> that vincent <unk> to <unk> with <unk> out of fear rather than <unk> . later , <unk> <unk> ' s act of <unk> could be <unk> by <unk> , but we <unk> ' re never sure . <eos>
<bos> none of the stories are really <unk> " <unk> about <unk> " <unk> anything . they certainly are not about hit - men <unk> about <unk> . <unk> is the film really a <unk> or a <unk> , although it <unk> elements of both . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> <unk> because she seemed to be the only <unk> character in the movie . <eos>
<bos> and the cinematography ? welcome to the old days of film . the <unk> days of hollywood . anderson gives us one of the most beautifully shot and directed films in recent memory <eos>
<bos> every moment feels more epic than the last , until the film becomes such a <unk> cinematic <unk> that the end leaves the viewer <unk> . <eos>
<bos> and <unk> is n ' t gon na be in <unk> again any time soon . but in the <unk> , there will be blood is just about as good , and will likely <unk> our generation as much as the hollywood <unk> <unk> of the past ... <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was max <unk> , his <unk> world <unk> is wonderful . <eos>
<bos> the <unk> of max <unk> ' s middle - class background with the <unk> and <unk> lives of most <unk> <unk> <unk> max <unk> ' s <unk> to make a name for himself . <eos>
<bos> they simply will not <unk> to those out there who want <unk> hollywood <unk> . <eos>
<bos> anderson breaks <unk> in ways no one has done before <unk> - <unk> one has to understand that his films are deep where most films are <unk> , and <unk> where most films are deep . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a <unk> intense , <unk> <unk> movie , i love horror movies , but it was ridiculous in the amount of gore . <eos>
<bos> of course as has been the case with all the sequels <unk> far , the message is n ' t quite as clear here as it was in the original , and the <unk> always seem to be <unk> the gore rather than the other <unk> - more <unk> - <unk> way around <eos>
<bos> a <unk> , but still on mission . <eos>
<bos> not enough for anyone else , but fans should enjoy it for the most part . <eos>
<bos> but it <unk> ' s still solid and entertaining . <eos>
<bos> although it <unk> ' s easy to <unk> total <unk> in a very <unk> <unk> , so that the <unk> of what we <unk> ' re seeing at any particular moment and the <unk> of the dialogue are the <unk> reality , very convincing <unk> can be made that the <unk> of the film is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> ' s memory <unk> while in the <unk> " <unk> <unk> <unk> ' s <unk> <unk> " <unk> at <unk> . <eos>
<bos> what <unk> more than thinking one has a <unk> " <unk> right <unk> <unk> " <unk> , though , is the <unk> <unk> story that <unk> our <unk> and the amount of fun we have getting there . <eos>

<bos> the biggest <unk> of this film was the plot . it went from a mission to <unk> a <unk> hard - drive to a mission to <unk> an old <unk> ( who could <unk> ' ve easily been killed several times ) . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was <unk> <eos>
<bos> a young man , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> up on a <unk> , looking up <unk> to see two young children ( <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ) playing in the <unk> before he <unk> out . <eos>

<bos> most actors would believe the only <unk> of the character is to be good looking , but <unk> takes it a step further and makes edward <unk> very <unk> , <unk> , and in the end , a good hero for the audience . <eos>
<bos> okay , i do n ' t really know what <unk> the writer of this screenplay to make it so horrible ( was it the <unk> material ? ) , because the <unk> is just so bad that i laughed at serious moments . there <unk> ' s a lot of <unk> humor , mostly in the beginning when <unk> and edward feel like <unk> <unk> in love . i guess the movie <unk> along okay , because i was n ' t <unk> at all <eos>

<bos> the <unk> moments , not the <unk> , that make it so <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i think it was the <unk> that gave this movie the bad reviews by some <unk> <unk> , as let <unk> ' s face it , it can totally <unk> a movie for some people . <eos>

<bos> this is the worst of the <unk> - <unk> <unk> by a long shot . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was obviously the main character because through his <unk> he was able to escape a dangerous situation . <eos>
<bos> <unk> <unk> returns as kevin and the running joke other than him being some rich <unk> <unk> is that he <unk> ' s in love with <unk> , which never <unk> to anything . <eos>

<bos> <unk> , the sad death of actor paul <unk> <unk> ' s brings a <unk> to the story which the screenplay could have never <unk> by itself . <eos>
<bos> the <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> 7 are making some people talk about the <unk> of <unk> a special <unk> for <unk> <unk> at the <unk> ; and i think that <unk> ' s an excellent idea . <eos>
<bos> there <unk> ' s <unk> <unk> <unk> in those scenes ( <unk> of <unk> , face <unk> , general <unk> ) , but there <unk> ' s still an <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> talent involved in the shooting of those scenes , something which would <unk> a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one with <unk> where he <unk> about his <unk> stand during the battle . <eos>
<bos> the original gang all return along with shrek and <unk> . <eos>
<bos> there are also a number of <unk> voice <unk> including <unk> king and <unk> <unk> and all add up to a <unk> time at the movies . <eos>

<bos> the best thing about this movie is that they did n ' t kill off the black guy . <eos>
<bos> if kids are n ' t <unk> by <unk> , they will probably enjoy the movie . i highly recommend <unk> park . <eos>

<bos> i liked the one which the team set up the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> this time around with a <unk> new script and an <unk> <unk> cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original . <eos>
<bos> the fact is that there is no main character or personality . they are all in it together <unk> - <unk> <unk> the sense of the film in real life . <eos>
<bos> the easy <unk> between <unk> , pitt , <unk> <unk> al <unk> throughout the film and seems to <unk> the audience in to their <unk> circle . <eos>

<bos> <unk> tale <eos>
<bos> never watched it . <eos>
<bos> less action than the first <eos>
<bos> read the books . <eos>
<bos> so what you are saying then is that the other 2 books in the series are pretty much <unk> then and really not worth <unk> ? <eos>
<bos> the film <unk> almost everything pretty <unk> <eos>
<bos> i think it was the best in the franchise . <eos>
<bos> just let the franchise die in <unk> . in my opinion it <unk> with the second movie . <eos>
<bos> the characters that <unk> the <unk> " <unk> shrek <unk> " <unk> universe <unk> as <unk> as ever in <unk> , but after four movies there is little that can be done to keep them animated , so to speak . <eos>
<bos> just before the king <unk> the <unk> , a <unk> <unk> in and <unk> that princess <unk> has been saved . <eos>
<bos> the animation is as <unk> as ever and it never <unk> to <unk> how <unk> a film can look that has a talking donkey at its center . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the team <unk> there powers <eos>
<bos> <unk> continues <unk> the <unk> against the four , <unk> them down . <eos>
<bos> as a comic book fan i felt like <unk> <unk> just <unk> me in the face by using so very little of the actual <unk> . he basically used the name of a comic i love to get me to see it and then gave me a different movie . <eos>
<bos> none of the characters <unk> their comic <unk> part . they were all too young so of course <unk> <unk> did n ' t have <unk> <unk> , who thought it would be a good idea to make a <unk> guy the thing ? <eos>
<bos> i really hope this movie does n ' t kill the career <unk> ' s of the cast . they really are the only good thing about this movie . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was john <unk> because he is a complete <unk> . <eos>
<bos> not your average action movie <eos>
<bos> the buddy action film has never been better . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s also the only die hard film where john <unk> is actually working in his own <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the first 3 are obviously <unk> but i also really liked the <unk> one <eos>
<bos> i think it was one of the best <unk> <unk> movies ever . <eos>
<bos> not only is the script powerful , but the <unk> between the characters <unk> - <unk> all of them <unk> , even <unk> <unk> - <unk> is <unk> and <unk> <unk> . <eos>
<bos> a slow <unk> , a fine achievement <eos>

<bos> i think it was a <unk> movie <unk> how everyone should help others as much as they can . it <unk> ' s also <unk> sad . <eos>
<bos> it is the typical american <unk> house , but it looks as though it were in the middle of a war <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i was <unk> to see it , having read the book several times , and i <unk> ' m a fan of hollywood <unk> ' s first <unk> of the original tale , the <unk> man ( <unk> ) . <eos>

<bos> <unk> - wan <unk> , because the <unk> of <unk> - wan <unk> <unk> that this other <unk> is luke <unk> ' s <unk> sister , <unk> . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s not the <unk> of the trilogy <unk> - <unk> it <unk> ' s the most <unk> . <eos>
<bos> all the fun of the original with a much better , <unk> plot . <eos>
<bos> the performances are terrific , especially by <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> , and billy <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the <unk> , with a <unk> <unk> between <unk> <unk> and luke <unk> , is truly one of the most <unk> and dramatic scenes in the entire series . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> , because she is so <unk> but <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the <unk> episode has <unk> <unk> <unk> ' s parents that they should give jim a second chance and they <unk> a <unk> <unk> . <eos>
<bos> jim <unk> to <unk> that everyone will be gone that night so he can have his <unk> moment with <unk> <unk> ' s <unk> . unfortunately , <unk> , thinking that jim will be home alone , sees it as the perfect moment for the <unk> party to take place . <eos>
<bos> ok , i admit it . american <unk> movies are <unk> , <unk> and <unk> stupid ... but i love them ! this movie , in my opinion , was the best in the series because it was ... well , the funniest . and also a little touching . <eos>
<bos> if you do n ' t like <unk> and ridiculous <unk> , then this film is not for you . it <unk> ' ll probably <unk> to people in the <unk> - <unk> age <unk> most , but pretty much everyone who <unk> it will laugh at least once . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a good movie . the ending was good but not what i was expecting . <eos>
<bos> i wish they had n ' t <unk> with the <unk> . it would <unk> ' ve been really nice to end the movie on the last word . <eos>
<bos> <unk> is nearly killed by one creature but she and <unk> fight them off ( she with her <unk> and <unk> - <unk> <unk> , and he with his <unk> <unk> ) as they stand back to back fighting . <eos>
<bos> i did n ' t expected it to be a great movie , just a good action one , and it <unk> . <eos>
<bos> do not understand of the 10 / 10 <unk> with respect to this film . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> <unk> . kevin <unk> did an awesome job <unk> such an interesting character . <eos>
<bos> <unk> <unk> it in <unk> . <eos>
<bos> all the other films had completely different <unk> and even though i love a deep and brilliant story my main <unk> when i see a film is to be <unk> and basically no film does that better than the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the acting is nothing short of brilliant . this is without a doubt kevin <unk> <unk> ' s best role . some people have <unk> that he seemed <unk> and <unk> to <unk> the emotion of the character and to that i can only ask : were we watching the same movie ? ! he is a <unk> <unk> believable all the way through . <eos>
<bos> charles martin smith does a good job as well and even though his character is very <unk> he still manages to pull the audience in . <eos>
<bos> i think it was pretty good . <eos>
<bos> too many <unk> " <unk> yes men <unk> " <unk> around george <unk> <eos>
<bos> a solid but <unk> <unk> to the star wars <unk> <eos>
<bos> this is the film that <unk> my <unk> and love for star wars . will always have a place in my heart for it . <eos>
<bos> <unk> may have problems as a director and writer , but i <unk> ' ve always thought that those <unk> are <unk> by his great <unk> <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i liked the scene in the <unk> where the <unk> <unk> show up and jason is <unk> them all over . <eos>
<bos> at <unk> , jason continues <unk> around the <unk> while <unk> on the kids who <unk> down for a party at the <unk> <unk> . <eos>
<bos> what is excellent about this film are some of the same elements that made <unk> good . <eos>
<bos> you get to see more of fox <unk> from the <unk> and in a truly <unk> <unk> moment , you get to see all of andy , <unk> up after he gets <unk> in two walking on his hands . <eos>
<bos> the best <unk> with a <unk> atmosphere . <unk> the franchise <unk> into a <unk> , yet enjoyable <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the last <unk> <unk> to <unk> . <eos>
<bos> they <unk> ' re <unk> weird , like they were created in a post - <unk> <unk> <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the movie itself is <unk> <unk> . it starts off as a typical <unk> : a few <unk> leaving <unk> get <unk> in the <unk> , then they <unk> strange characters , and from then it <unk> into a <unk> <unk> battle between everyone . <eos>
<bos> the only reason anyone would have any <unk> to watch this is because of its leads <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> who were young and <unk> back then , but they did they best they could with the material they had . <eos>
<bos> <unk> : <unk> was actually directed by the dude that <unk> - <unk> the original with <unk> <unk> . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . <eos>
<bos> first time my mother ever <unk> in a cinema . guess which scene . <eos>
<bos> the intelligent viewer will be <unk> to <unk> with such a person . <eos>
<bos> <unk> walks through this film as if he was in a <unk> or half <unk> ; he has no <unk> . <eos>
<bos> at some point he gets his first <unk> , gets <unk> in <unk> ( the <unk> art form for <unk> <unk> people ) during high school ( have n ' t we seen that already too many times ? ) , goes to college at which point the film ends . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one with <unk> where he <unk> about his <unk> stand during the battle . <eos>
<bos> as long as i get more eddie <unk> , i <unk> ' m good . <eos>
<bos> an entertaining <unk> , even if the series is no longer <unk> <eos>
<bos> i just want an actual ending to the series . a fucking <unk> <unk> movie is not an ending <eos>
<bos> there were moments in there that felt like the first two films , and overall it is a very enjoyable ride that even though it does n ' t live quite up to the first two films . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which he was playing <unk> in a <unk> <eos>
<bos> jim <unk> in his <unk> day would have been a better joker than he was the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> when this movie <unk> on <unk> they show the <unk> station scene for <unk> . <eos>
<bos> also <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> scene for <unk> . <eos>
<bos> sure , this is <unk> comedy , but jim <unk> makes it memorable . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> because he was <unk> . <eos>
<bos> first off , <unk> works with <unk> effort all of the <unk> <unk> of the film . <eos>
<bos> it even starts with a double <unk> effect , <unk> with some sad <unk> of a beautiful <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> ahead of us . <eos>
<bos> one shot especially , from a <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> shot is <unk> . nothing to <unk> from hollywood <unk> class . <eos>
<bos> but the main <unk> of the movie comes from the powerful <unk> <unk> director <unk> has over characters , <unk> and <unk> . many moments are <unk> <unk> , scary and very , very intense . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character was <unk> because i relate to him as an <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i think <unk> has taken over woody <unk> <unk> ' s job as this generation <unk> ' s <unk> <unk> who <unk> <unk> into everything . <eos>

<bos> the ending of that movie <unk> my heart apart . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which dr. <unk> shows the kids how to <unk> the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i do n ' t know why i loved this movie so much . <eos>
<bos> maybe it was the <unk> <unk> when i first saw the <unk> <unk> from a tree . <eos>
<bos> or maybe it was my <unk> <unk> when two <unk> year old were attacked by <unk> . <eos>
<bos> it might possibly be the <unk> that went down my <unk> when the t - <unk> first made his terrifying <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great movie . <eos>
<bos> simple horror at its best . <eos>
<bos> in the back room , she discovers an <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> ' <unk> head ( now <unk> ) on it , <unk> by the <unk> of the recent <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the final <unk> minutes are quite tension - filled and better than anything in the original . <eos>
<bos> steve <unk> did n ' t <unk> around too much with sean <unk> <unk> ' s successful <unk> simply <unk> some quite <unk> kills and <unk> . <eos>
<bos> <unk> and <unk> are <unk> having sex , but not knowing the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> both of them <unk> through the bed with a <unk> . <eos>

<bos> <unk> <unk> ' s car <eos>
<bos> my favorite <unk> was <unk> <unk> <eos>
<bos> i have seen this film over , well , an <eos>
<bos> <unk> is sitting in his office at the car <unk> talking on the phone . <eos>
<bos> <unk> clearly tries to get the man off the phone as quickly as he can while still being <unk> about the <unk> <eos>
<bos> many people seem to like <unk> for its <unk> <unk> , its <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <eos>
<bos> brilliant writing , its <unk> musical score , its <unk> plot , william <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and steve <unk> , <eos>
<bos> how many movies can you remember when the only two <unk> characters were both revealed to be <unk> <eos>
<bos> a masterpiece of <unk> <unk> . <eos>
<bos> <unk> would make a great <unk> play ; you could <unk> the modern elements and still have created a buzz <unk> years ago in <unk> <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the plot is similar to <unk> <unk> ' s , in that they both have characters we <unk> for who create <unk> plans <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which the team <unk> there powers <eos>
<bos> did <unk> forget in the final fight that 5 minutes earlier he was killing people with a <unk> ? <eos>
<bos> there is more action in a <unk> <unk> fight . <eos>
<bos> they just did n ' t feel like a team <unk> - <unk> there was no bond between them , and that <unk> ' s what should certainly be <unk> in a movie like this . <eos>
<bos> i really hope this movie does n ' t kill the career <unk> ' s of the cast . <eos>
<bos> i think it was exciting and <unk> stunning . <eos>

<bos> my favorite character was <unk> . he <unk> ' s intelligent , but <unk> . he <unk> ' s not afraid to speak his mind . he <unk> ' s funny and he plays well off <unk> <unk> ' s character . <eos>
<bos> he does n ' t know how to use a gun , he has no <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> ' s never had to take on <unk> before . <eos>
<bos> these two have a chemistry that at least <unk> <unk> and <unk> and if there <unk> ' s a die hard sequel , jackson needs to come back . <eos>
<bos> that movie is the reason why i <unk> ' ll forever know how to do that classic <unk> where you have to use only a five <unk> <unk> and a three <unk> <unk> to <unk> up the big one with exactly four <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the buddy action film has never been better . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a very funny and enjoyable movie . <eos>
<bos> their first <unk> of action ends incredibly <unk> when <unk> <unk> the <unk> on his red <unk> and <unk> into the crime scene . <eos>
<bos> will <unk> is back ! mark <unk> is perfect . <eos>
<bos> the <unk> humor was <unk> and the chemistry between <unk> mark and will <unk> is <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the story of the movie is pretty predictable but there <unk> is non stop <unk> through the entire film . <eos>
<bos> i like the one in which the main character <unk> ' s <unk> was shot down in the beginning of the movie . <eos>
<bos> quality comedies <unk> - <unk> - <unk> if they go beyond one sequel <unk> - <unk> - <unk> never come in <unk> . <eos>
<bos> in the case of <unk> " <unk> little <unk> , <unk> " <unk> three <unk> ' s a <unk> <unk> . <eos>
<bos> but we <unk> for it ; <unk> " <unk> meet the <unk> <unk> " <unk> <unk> as the <unk> - <unk> live - action comedy in the <unk> s. , so <unk> of quality , we were going to get whatever <unk> <unk> us . <eos>
<bos> and sure enough , <unk> " <unk> little <unk> <unk> " <unk> <unk> up <unk> modern <unk> , basically <unk> that the last <unk> of comedy ( including its two <unk> ) ever <unk> and that we could be won over by open <unk> of sex ( <unk> ! ) and <unk> <unk> drug <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> <unk> <unk> his dark personality , <unk> , <unk> to get out . <eos>
<bos> it would have been more exciting if the audience did n ' t expect them when they <unk> into the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> when <unk> and <unk> start working on a case they have a lead in , one they get to before other <unk> <unk> do , a really interesting detective story <unk> that would not feel out of place in <unk> like <unk> " <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> " <unk> ( <unk> ) or similar action / detective movies to that nature . <unk> " <unk> when you do a comedy , it does no good to <unk> comedies , <unk> " <unk> writer and director adam <unk> told entertainment <eos>
<bos> more than that , though , <unk> did n ' t get all the funny lines , which is the <unk> that many buddy cop movies such as the recent <unk> " <unk> cop out <unk> " <unk> ( 2010 ) make . <eos>
<bos> his line about being a <unk> may make <unk> <unk> ' s most memorable movie <unk> list in the next few years , and the hot water his character got into in an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( making a <unk> as himself ) made the audience at my <unk> <unk> . <eos>
<bos> predictable but not <unk> <unk> to the <unk> family <eos>

<bos> i think it was a great ending to an <unk> trilogy . <eos>
<bos> i thought it was good , honestly , not really as great as the second film , but , <unk> was a tough act to follow . <eos>
<bos> they <unk> ' re all rather <unk> but damn it if i do n ' t have a really good time watching these movies . <eos>
<bos> not as dark as the previous <unk> <unk> <unk> , but still a <unk> to watch . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a great movie and a good modern twist on the classic . <eos>
<bos> i am not a <unk> , i was looking forward to this <eos>
<bos> this film , to me , was more like a terrible modern high school <unk> - <unk> adaptation than a remake . <eos>
<bos> every <unk> ' <unk> <unk> ' <unk> in this film is the <unk> <unk> music and <unk> <unk> into <unk> . <eos>
<bos> why not just make a new sequel with a great script and high production <unk> ? <eos>

<bos> i think it was the best in the franchise . <eos>
<bos> an entertaining <unk> , even if the series is no longer <unk> <eos>
<bos> in my opinion it <unk> with the second movie . <eos>
<bos> i just want an actual ending to the series . <eos>
<bos> overall it is a very enjoyable ride that even though it does n ' t live quite up to the first two films . <eos>
<bos> my favorite character from the movie is <unk> <unk> , mostly because of the actor who plays him and how he plays him in a way that <unk> to his <unk> <unk> . <eos>

<bos> the <unk> we have with <unk> and jack helps create that humor and some clever jokes actually do <unk> , but the script <unk> on typical <unk> " <unk> <unk> <unk> " <unk> plot <unk> , most of which were <unk> used most <unk> in <unk> " <unk> meet the parents <unk> " <unk> and <unk> " <unk> meet the <unk> . <unk> " <unk> <eos>
<bos> <unk> jokes such as young <unk> <unk> <unk> if girls <unk> from their <unk> at the <unk> <unk> , could have been <unk> with something more <unk> <unk> - <unk> - <unk> and <unk> . <eos>
<bos> nothing <unk> like a <unk> - <unk> title . <eos>
<bos> i think it was a fun movie . <eos>
<bos> peter parker ( andrew <unk> ) <unk> into a <unk> <unk> and gets <unk> by a <unk> / <unk> <unk> spider . he gets super powers and becomes spider - man . <eos>
<bos> this is not a bad film . it <unk> ' s well acted by all the <unk> , has good effects , a scary and <unk> villain , some nice action sequences and <unk> <unk> effects that are <unk> slightly more realistic than the <unk> version . <eos>
<bos> it <unk> ' s <unk> to say that for anyone over the age of <unk> , this movie will seem rather half - <unk> and <unk> ; for those under <unk> , this movie will probably be the greatest super hero flick ever . <eos>
<bos> however the <unk> <unk> around <unk> <unk> it down for me . <eos>
<bos> i think it was very entertaining and a good family movie . <eos>
<bos> <unk> agrees but <unk> <unk> another <unk> and <unk> <unk> and jack on a <unk> island ( the same island jack was on ten years before ) and throws jack <unk> ' s crew into the <unk> . <eos>

<bos> one of the greatest films ever ? i do n ' t think that <unk> ' s an <unk> , and i <unk> ' m not just saying it cause i <unk> ' m a bill <unk> fan and he happens to be in it . <eos>
<bos> the whole thing is seriously funny and somehow seriously real , but at the same time does n ' t always take itself seriously . <eos>
<bos> but i do n ' t think plot <unk> <unk> when it comes to making a quality film . it has a fantastic script , believable character development , and top - <unk> acting , and that <unk> ' s what <unk> in making a memorable film . <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> was <unk> how <unk> work <eos>
<bos> there is only one word to <unk> the cinematography , the set <unk> and the special effects , and that is <unk> ! <eos>

<bos> <unk> , who is still <unk> known for jack <unk> played by him in <unk> , should be <unk> as his role as <unk> <unk> will be <unk> forever . his performance may or may not <unk> him an oscar but it will be his finest performance <unk> date . <eos>
<bos> when <unk> was alone in the van towards the end in the water , still <unk> , would n ' t he have been killed in the dream because of the water ? and would n ' t that have put him into <unk> ? <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> sees a strange man on the <unk> <unk> , but he turns out to be a giant <unk> who <unk> <unk> and grabs her . <eos>
<bos> she offers them $ 10 for everything ; they <unk> it and leave . <eos>

<bos> i think it was an epic tale which perfectly portrayed the <unk> of those who are <unk> at what they are <unk> about . <eos>
<bos> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> at the <unk> <unk> ' s <unk> , but they are not <unk> introduced . <eos>
<bos> <unk> sees that <unk> , <unk> is <unk> and <unk> . <eos>

<bos> i liked the one which the team set up the <unk> . <eos>
<bos> <unk> still appears <unk> until <unk> <unk> tells him to <unk> " <unk> get in the god damn house <unk> " <unk> with <unk> else . <eos>
<bos> however , this time around with a <unk> new script and an <unk> <unk> cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original . <eos>
<bos> in the case of this <unk> we are safe in the <unk> that the actors at least wanted to be there and that they all had fun making it . <eos>

<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> realizes in the <unk> ending that the <unk> humans still have some of their humanity . <eos>
<bos> robert , <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> . <eos>
<bos> during the <unk> fight , robert has time to realize that the <unk> female he had captured earlier and <unk> the <unk> <unk> on , has come back to her human form . <eos>
<bos> this film could easily have filled <unk> hours of <unk> . <eos>
<bos> the original ending would have probably been better , but we <unk> ' ve only got the one . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> meets <unk> <unk> . <eos>
<bos> through his <unk> <unk> <unk> a love interest , <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , a <unk> / <unk> who has come to the academy to view <unk> <unk> ' s cop <unk> and takes a <unk> to former gang leader <unk> . <eos>

<bos> he <unk> ' s never wanted a human <unk> ' s blood as much as he wants <unk> . <eos>
<bos> <unk> <unk> that she does n ' t care and <unk> she <unk> him to <unk> control . <eos>
<bos> the movie made me realize just how <unk> the book <unk> ' s dialogue was . <eos>
<bos> the movie is definitely worth watching . the visuals are <unk> , the acting is convincing and its message is important and very <unk> . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which <unk> finally meets <unk> in <unk> . <eos>
<bos> before <unk> can shoot him to end his <unk> and <unk> him up , <unk> stops him and explains that , due to the <unk> they <unk> ' ve taken , they wo n ' t <unk> up if they die . <eos>
<bos> <unk> had been involved so much in his <unk> work that he had lost his love ! <eos>
<bos> you do n ' t just watch the scenes happening , you feel them . <eos>
<bos> <unk> <unk> ' s first true masterpiece . <eos>
<bos> i liked the one in which kirk fights <unk> a <unk> who has <unk> herself into kirk <unk> ' s body double . <eos>
<bos> among them is the <unk> <unk> , who <unk> his government <unk> ' s <unk> of kirk . <eos>
<bos> this is the best of the film series for several reasons . <eos>
<bos> the <unk> attack scene at the end is great <unk> action and was better than <unk> <unk> ' s attack on the <unk> in part ii <eos>
<bos> the best of the bunch with the original cast . a great <unk> - off ! <eos>
